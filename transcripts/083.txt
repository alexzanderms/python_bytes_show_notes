00:00:00 KENNEDY: Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds. This is Episode 83, recorded June 20th, 2018. I'm Michael Kennedy.
 
00:00:09 OKKEN: And I'm Brian Okken.
 
00:00:10 KENNEDY: And Brian, we have a special guest, don't we?
 
00:00:11 OKKEN: Yes, we do.
 
00:00:11 KENNEDY: Yeah, so Cris Medina is here to join in the fun and share his perspective on things. Hey, Cris, welcome to the show.
 
00:00:18 MEDINA: Hey, guys, how's it going? Good to be here.
 
00:00:20 KENNEDY: Yeah, it's good to have you. And I also want to say thank you to DigitalOcean. They are a major, major sponsor of the show, and they're sponsoring this one as well. Tell you more about them, but, the short version is, pythonbytes.fm/digitalocean get $100 credit for new users. Brian, speaking of new users, when people learn to Python, they might want to set up a server at some point.
 
00:00:39 OKKEN: Set up a server?
 
00:00:40 KENNEDY: Well, you know, eventually, eventually they'll have a website or something, right? Once they learn to code, but you've got a really nice way for them to get started.
 
00:00:48 OKKEN: I have always been reluctant to try to look or play with some of these beginning code editors because part of learning how to code is learning an editor, but I'm kind of warming to the idea of some of these specialized editors, and there's one that I wasn't familiar with which is Mu, I think it's Moo or Mew, I don't know. M U, Code With Mu. It's got a whole bunch of people on board. If I go to the, can't remember where it is, but there's a bunch of people working on this and it's kind of a neat little editor that has, I was playing with it this morning, and it has some, you just open it up, and it has built-in right off the bat, it asks you if you're going to do it for Python 3 or if you're targeting like an Adafruit chip, or a Micro:bit, so it has built-in targeting of those things like right away, and there's, like, along the top, there's some icons for loading and saving files, running it, debugging it, popping up the REPL, interacting with the plotter, and then there's a, even there's a theme button so you can jump back and forth between dark theme and light theme, and it even has like a linter built in, so you can check things, and it's all, like, you don't have to memorize any key sequences or there's not really any menus around. It just is all up there, and I think this actually would be great for teaching people how to code, so, I'm going to start using it for demos and stuff.
 
00:02:17 KENNEDY: It's pretty cool, yeah, so as you type, basically, it pulls up both the completion for the arguments that go to a method or something, but also the documentation, like while you're typing, so you might get annoyed with that if you know what you're doing, but if you're new, it's really cool, it'll show you, like, hey, you can call these graet things, and here's the arguments, here's what it means, and it even has a debug, it's pretty cool.
 
00:02:40 MEDINA: So it's a separate app?
 
00:02:42 KENNEDY: Yeah, it's a separate app, but you can, there's an installer available, so you can just, you don't even have to tell people about pip right away because you can just install it with an installer, but you can install it with pip, because it's just a Python thing. I think it's a QT app, or Cute, I've been corrected, it's a Qt application. Oh, that's really cool, it's Qt, okay.
 
00:03:03 OKKEN: Yeah, I installed it with pip, and then one of the things that it has in the installation instructions, is instructions on how to use, so when you install it with pip, you get like a command line invocation to invoke it, but it recommends using another package called shortcut, which you just, if you pip install shortcut, you get shortcut mu editor for instance and it'll create, on my Mac, it created a, it just went ahead and created a shortcut in my launchpad, to launch it, so it didn't...
 
00:03:37 KENNEDY: Oh, that's pretty cool.
 
00:03:37 OKKEN: So you could attach that to any Python script, you can just launch it from there, so.
 
00:03:44 KENNEDY: Nice, oh, but...
 
00:03:44 MEDINA: Looks like it has different owns, too, like you can set it up to work for writing code for Adafruit or Pygame or stuff like that. That looks kind of neat.
 
00:03:53 OKKEN: Yeah, and then, when, it has the built-in REPL if you pop open the REPL, it's not just your normal REPL, it's a Jupyter Notebook, or Jupyter REPL, which is pretty cool.
 
00:04:04 KENNEDY: Yeah, that's really cool, I love this. It's very neat.
 
00:04:07 OKKEN: And there's, like, in, on the Tutorials link, there's a whole bunch of tutorials that aren't quite there yet, so I'm guessing they could use some people to help out with this project.
 
00:04:18 KENNEDY: Oh, right, yeah, and that'd be a great, easy way to get, sort of get your feet wet in open source, is to write some tutorials, right? It's, you don't have too much to depend upon or you probably won't break anybody's code by writing one. Yeah, nice. So, Cris, one of the things I find that's pretty interesting is, we love to talk about super advanced topics, but a lot of times it's really what people need or want, especially if you're helping or mentoring someone else, is like some more fundamental stuff, right?
 
00:04:45 MEDINA: Yep, I've found most, a kind of an intro topic into how the Python parentheses system works, and it's pretty interesting also for folks that come from other languages, so you can get kind of like a quick translation from one place to another and how things operate.
 
00:05:01 KENNEDY: It sounds pretty simple, I mean, it's about Python parentheses, right? The Python parentheses primer from Reuven Lerner, shout out to him on that, but there's some pretty advanced things going on, and a pretty cool future feature coming at the end.
 
00:05:15 MEDINA: Right.
 
00:05:16 KENNEDY: So tell us about it.
 
00:05:16 MEDINA: So the fun stuff is, it goes into all the different ways that you actually use parentheses while you're doing your Python syntax and what you can use it for, so you get a couple of the simple topics, like, you know, usually a parentheses is used in a callable like, to call a function and passing parameters, or to call a class that implements callable, things like prioritization of operations or conditionals. You also use parentheses for making tuples, but you also get a little bit into generator expressions and the advantages of that, and a couple little quirks, so you can use it for skirting some of the indentation rules that Python has that some people kind of hate, but, other people, like me, love, so I'm special. You also get into square brackets and curly braces, and square brackets which are typically used for lists and for indexing, for somebody that's new to the topic, you'll want to look at the slices section, because slices are a pretty, pretty powerful little tool that you get out of Python, if you haven't used it before, how to get specific sections of a list or variable, and, there's also, while not in the article itself, but some of the folks that commented on the article also mentioned that some of the new type hint stuff also uses square brackets for identifying, like the variables, if you have a variable that's, say, a list, or a container, a class of some sort, the data type that it's implementing, so if you have a list of floats, you would say, list{floats} when you're specifying what type it is.
 
00:06:55 KENNEDY: Yeah, that's really interesting. It's almost like generics, in, like, C# or templates in C++, where you would say, this thing takes a list of strings. You can say it's just a list, but then, like, you don't get any help on what's contained within it, or you could say, you know, import the list thing and say list[Int], then it has to be a homogeneous list of ints, not just any random list, which is pretty cool.
 
00:07:19 MEDINA: Exactly.
 
00:07:19 KENNEDY: I was looking through here and down at the bottom, they're talking about some of the ways to like future-proof your code, so, like, you can say, from __future__ import division, and there's a proposal for braces, huh?
 
00:07:35 MEDINA: Uh-huh. If you have a Python REPL open right now and you kind of want to try that, you'll get a neat little message of what the future will look like if you ever actually import braces.
 
00:07:47 KENNEDY: Right, so if you can see the coming braces feature, you can say, from __future__ import braces, and see what support Python's probably going to be adding for braces soon. Which, you know, if not everyone's typing, they're probably driving themselves, too. Basically, it throws a syntax exception error and says not a chance, we're never adding braces. It's beautiful. I knew about antigravity, we were joking about that earlier, but I did know about the import braces. That's pretty sweet.
 
00:08:14 MEDINA: One more interesting thing to mention, obviously goes to curly braces and how you'd use that as well for the set comprehensions and dictionaries. The other thing to remind folks is, Python 3.6 plus, there is f-strings, and with f-strings you can use the braces inside a string that you prefix with f, too, and the interpreter replaces any code that you put inside those braces, actually executes it and replaces the result into the string.
 
00:08:41 KENNEDY: Yeah, very nice. The f-strings are great.
 
00:08:43 MEDINA: And it's way more efficient.
 
00:08:44 KENNEDY: Fastest and the shortest, cleanest, very nice. So, Brian, you've mentioned that that Mu Editor is a Qt application, and Qt is kind of making a bit of a resurgence these days.
 
00:08:55 OKKEN: At least I've been paying more attention to it, yeah.
 
00:08:57 KENNEDY: Yeah, well, it had gone through some fairly dark times. I mean, obviously we've been on our GUI kick for a while. We went through all these different options, and there's still tons of great options, like wxPython had their Phoenix release, which was sort of a rebuilding of that whole thing which is awesome, and a little while ago, we talked about that, so, the Qt company, QT company, is the company that is behind the Qt framework and they just announced the official release for Python For Qt, which is taking these various version mismatch, PySide2, PyQt, all these things, and like rebuilding it, like in a two year project, into a fresh new shiny version, so that's pretty awesome that that's more or less out.
 
00:09:38 OKKEN: That's exciting, we're, we heard recent, not too long ago, that it was coming, but having it be released, wonderful.
 
00:09:45 KENNEDY: Yeah, so if you're messing with this, it's version 5.11 and I think it's still in a tech preview in terms of the execution bits, but I suspect that this means the APIs are frozen, so you can go and check that out. Yeah, so it started two years ago, they've been working on this, and one thing that's really nice with the way you get it, is you just pip install, and they, right now, it's not coming out of pypi.org itself, it's coming out of a different place, so they show you the command like to pass their particular sort of dev, their dev index URL, which I put in the show notes, so people can check that out.
 
00:10:19 MEDINA: And that looks like they have their own PyPI implementation there.
 
00:10:24 KENNEDY: Yeah, something like that, right? Like, a little bit like what you guys are doing that we've talked about over on Talk Python, right, Cris?
 
00:10:29 MEDINA: Yep, exactly.
 
00:10:30 KENNEDY: But this one goes outside the firewall, it looks like.
 
00:10:32 MEDINA: Uh-huh.
 
00:10:32 KENNEDY: Nice, so, you know, I just want to give a shout out, people who are looking, waiting for Qt to become more important to get revitalized, I feel like, you know, this is the announcement we've been waiting for. Hopefully, this means lots of good things. We'll see what happens.
 
00:10:47 OKKEN: Yeah, pretty cool.
 
00:10:49 KENNEDY: Yeah, for sure. So, speaking of good things, DigitalOcean, they're very good. They do all sorts of awesome stuff, right? They're giving you guys tons of credit if you want to get started there, and I always try to talk about different ways we are using them in our various bits of infrastructure, and that's still true, still are still enjoying that, but one of the things that they have that's really cool is when you go create a virtual machine, you can say, I want a one-click app, which really means a virtual machine configured to run something, and they recently set up a machine learning virtual machine for you, so you can go there, create a droplet, that's their VM terminology, click on One-Click Apps, pick Machine Learning and AI, and you'll automatically get a machine with Python 3, R, Jupyter Notebooks, TensorFlow, PyTorch, all that stuff, and pick like a CPU optimized, optimized CPU for your virtual machine. All sorts of good stuff, so, if you want to check that out, you can do it real quick, and affordably. Just play around with those tools, which is pretty awesome. So check them out over at pythonbytes.fm/digitalocean and like I said, if you go there and you're a new user, you'll get a hundred dollars credit, which is also pretty sweet. So, Brian, iteration is a key element of Python, right?
 
00:12:00 OKKEN: Yeah, we often deal with lots of iteration and generators and iterators and all sorts of things.
 
00:12:06 KENNEDY: Exactly, we've got generators, like the primary for loop is not for i = 0, i++, but it's for thing in collection, it's beautiful, right? But it goes even deeper.
 
00:12:15 OKKEN: Developing your own iterators and generators is a fun thing to learn about, but I have to admit that I don't often do that very much, and one of the things that I, it's always been on my to-do list, is to learn more about the itertools module, and I've not really ever explored it too much, and Real Python has a blog post called, Itertools In Python 3, By Example, and I really enjoyed this, it's a nice introduction as to what is the problem that iterators and generators are dealing with? And then, like for example, it starts off with just, how does zip work, to take two lists and create another list with each element, and then what if you need, what if you need like not quite the same zip? What if they're not the same length, and things like that, and some of the problems that can happen, and why lazy evaluation is a good thing, and actually, in the discussion, it used the time function, the time shell function, is I guess this is like a Unix-y type kind of thing, with a -f, which I've never used before, and that showed the memory used also. Didn't know that was a thing.
 
00:13:26 KENNEDY: Oh, that's cool.
 
00:13:27 OKKEN: But it had this example of using, like a big example and the memory usage blew up to like, huge, and so, it's just talked through, like, some of the different things that are in itertools and why that helps you. I pulled out a couple, like, a lot of these things, if you don't know they're there, you'll just come up with it on your own, like, doing combinatorial sets, those are already in there, coming up with permutations you don't have to do, like a random index, you can just use their iterate, the ones that are built in.
 
00:14:01 KENNEDY: I think that's a good example of being fluent in Python versus being able to make the code work, but not really deeply knowing it, right? Like, if somebody said, hey, I want you to take this thing and generate a set of permutations, all the permutations of, say, of this word or whatever, right, you might attempt to implement the fairly complicated algorithm, or, you might just call itertools, you know, permute sort of thing, right? And then boom, it's just there, so there's so many things like that that are just like, at your fingertips if you just import them.
 
00:14:27 OKKEN: Yeah, I mean we've all, a lot of people are smart enough to like, if you come up with all the combinations, you can just have a nested for loop and figure out how to do that, but you don't have to, it's already there. And one of the things I didn't know, there's some fun things like some fun uses of count and cycle, I didn't know about cycle . That's pretty cool, it just kind of cycles through a set and then keeps giving you more of the same, and the tutorial also talks about, in the tutorial, it's using the next function, which is for iterators, you don't have to use them in a loop, you can even, you just call the next function, which is kind of fun, and then something that's islice, I didn't know this was a thing, so if you don't know how to take a slice of a list or a slice of some other iterator, you can do that, but if you want that to be an iterable also, this does it for you. And so there's a whole bunch of goodies in here.
 
00:15:26 KENNEDY: Yeah, one of my favorites is islice because, like Cris already said, slicing is awesome, but if you try to do, say, slice on a generator, it'll just go, fail, and like, nope, we don't slice generators. Well, you can islice them, and it works just fine. It's beautiful, right? So it's, you sort of make things sliceable that otherwise would not be, it's really great.
 
00:15:45 OKKEN: Yeah, so that's definitely, definitely a good read to beef up on the itertools, soon.
 
00:15:51 MEDINA: Yeah, I recommend everybody that writes any Python code to just go look at itertools and all the things you can do. There's lots of stuff online and this is a good resource. Every once in a while, every time there's an article that's something about itertools, I always go, just at least skim it, because there's always some little magic in there, you're like, oh, I implemented that myself the other day. Let me go delete that code and actually do something that's maintained by somebody that knows something more than I.
 
00:16:17 KENNEDY: Yeah, and maybe even in C, so it's a little faster, right, down in the internals. Nice, so speaking of sort of working with collections and iterables and things like that, Cris, I feel like your item dovetails really in, well in with this.
 
00:16:29 MEDINA: Right, so, the next item is about Python sets and set theory. It's a nice, also kind of a primer on how sets work in Python, how you define them, how you work with them, and just a tiny bit on set theory, so you can build sets different ways. The most common way is by calling the set function to build an empty set, empty set, but you can also use curly braces, which we've been talking about earlier, to have set comprehensions, and it's a great way of say, de-duping items in a list so if you have a list of a bunch of integers or something like that, you can use the comprehension to iterate through the list and just grab the items that you care about and you only get the unique items out of it. The interesting part about sets, as well, is that they're all one, so when you're making a membership test, you can, it's fast, it's considerably faster than going through, say, a list where you have to iterate through the entire list to see if the item is in it.
 
00:17:28 KENNEDY: Yeah, that's cool. I definitely like the distinct aspect. That's what I use a lot of sets for, it's like, I have all these things, there might be duplication, I just want them, one of each, you know. If there's duplicates, just don't add it, right? So you can just, like, you could even say set of some list, and then, you know, just get that back as, here's the distinct stuff in the list, which is great. Also, for simplifying conditionals, so you have the example of, well, Real Python had the example in the stuff you covered about parentheses, of, if item = x, or item = y, or item = z or whatever, right, like, that becomes kind of a nasty, multi line looking thing. Maybe a more Pythonic way if you say, if x is in, you know, curly set x, y, z. Right, you can do stuff like that.
 
00:18:16 MEDINA: It's always, another point to keep in mind is, sets are, sets are of immutable value, so you can't put, like, say, a normal set inside of a set and there's other value types and stuff like that, you can't just, like, stick in a set.
 
00:18:33 KENNEDY: Right, so it has to be hashable. Basically, same as dictionary keys.
 
00:18:36 MEDINA: Exactly.
 
00:18:36 KENNEDY: Yeah. Yeah, right, so it can change.
 
00:18:37 MEDINA: But it's always interesting to remember once you've made a set that you're looking for distinct values and things like that, I always try to look through my code if there's some sort of, if I'm checking, if item is in list one, and also in list two, because you can always have two sets and do an intersection between them, and then you don't have to do those for loops and the code is kind of optimized to do that for you which I'm sure will not be all of them squared, I think, when you're writing your code, right?
 
00:19:06 KENNEDY: Yeah, exactly.
 
00:19:06 MEDINA: And then just do, quickly loop back on immutability, if you want to make a set of sets, there is also such a thing as a frozen set where the set itself is immutable, and you can stick that into a set, so, stuff like that.
 
00:19:21 KENNEDY: That's very meta. Brian, do you use sets very often?
 
00:19:23 OKKEN: I always have a tutorial like this or something to look up because I forget what the operators are because, you can, it does have a union intersection difference, metric difference, things like that, and remembering all of that stuff from your college days, it is good to try to make some elegant code but it has, like for instance, the union operator is, you just use the bar function for that, and looking up all those is a good thing, although, since I know I have to look it up, I usually put a comment in there to tell anybody else what I'm doing, to say, this is a set operation going on here, so.
 
00:20:02 KENNEDY: Yeah, that makes sense. I feel like sometimes knowing the right data structure can help, like, really open people's eyes or really change the way they're doing something, and sets and dictionaries definitely seem to fall into that, that space where, like, you don't use it that much, but when you do, you're like, whoa, that really is better in so many ways.
 
00:20:20 OKKEN: Yeah, and it's also one of those things of like, it's a new hammer, try to, try to be sure that you don't see everything as a set problem, because everything isn't a set problem.
 
00:20:31 KENNEDY: Yeah, for sure. All right, so last item that I wanted to cover on this episode is a little bit of a look ahead, maybe to next week, but to put this on people's radar so when it launches, you can, like, do maybe a back flip or something, if you've been practicing. So, coming up, we just had the release of Python 3.7 RC1, which was on June 12th, and expected or planned for June 27th, which is seven days from now, is the final release of Python 3.7 Official, how about that?
 
00:21:03 OKKEN: I'm so excited.
 
00:21:03 KENNEDY: Do you know what makes me most excited about this? There's certain things in here like, oh, okay, cool, breakpoint, that's kind of nice, data classes, kind of nice, but what really makes me most excited is this is the categorically fastest Python, period. So all the people that say, no, we're using legacy Python because under this particular use case, it's faster than Python 3.7, and there may still be some very narrow use case, but generally speaking, this is the fastest Python, period. It's much faster than Python 3... Certainly up to 3.3, but it's even quite a bit faster than 3.6, so, for example, from 3.6 to 3.7, when you're calling methods, especially methods that are part of classes, not standalone functions, but like bound methods to classes, it's like 20% faster.
 
00:21:49 MEDINA: That's a reason right there to switch.
 
00:21:51 KENNEDY: Yeah, and what's cool, like, all you've got to do is just run on the new version, right, there's no like, oh, I switched to PyPy or something, it's just, I now have 3.7, so life is better.
 
00:22:01 MEDINA: Especially if you're using a framework. Anybody who's using a framework, remember, there's a bunch of levels of abstraction around it, so there's a bunch of function calls.
 
00:22:09 KENNEDY: Exactly, yeah, there's tons of function calls, and so, this is really really good news, so just to run through some of the features, there's improvement to coupling, that, type annotations or type hints, added to the system, so previously, if I wanted to say, here's a function, and it returns this type of thing, right, it returns, like, this object, or some type I've defined, I have to literally import that type, at the top of that file, and what that means is, at import time, I pay an extra import of processing that file which I might not have otherwise loaded potentially or at least, not right then. But the other one is, circular dependencies are super annoying, in that, like so, for example, I've got like a repository class, and it returns some kind of object, right? But that object, when it's defined, has to know about the repository, so it says it returns, like it uses this somewhere else, like that basically will fail and break the import because it's circular. Right, so with this new thing, this change is, instead of actually evaluating these type hints and having to import them, it's just evaluated as if you had typed them as strings, so they're not actually evaluating the true types when you do type annotations, so that gives you more flexibility, the circular dependencies aren't a problem, and it's faster.
 
00:23:29 OKKEN: Wow, that's neat.
 
00:23:29 KENNEDY: Yeah, there wasn't this, the type annotations thing that makes me the most crazy is I have a class, and it's got like some function that returns an instance of itself, you can't say that in a previous type hints, as concrete types, because you can't say the name of a class until it's fully defined, but you're halfway through the class trying to say, this method returns one of me, you know? You can get around it by putting quotes, but that's effectively like what this does without the syntax to put in the quotes, so it looks more natural.
 
00:23:57 MEDINA: So you can do that now, with the 3.7?
 
00:24:00 KENNEDY: Yeah, but you have to put quotes and you have to like say the name out exactly as a string.
 
00:24:02 MEDINA: Oh, okay.
 
00:24:04 KENNEDY: Yeah, yeah, so.
 
00:24:04 MEDINA: That's, I think, I'll take a look at that.
 
00:24:05 KENNEDY: Yeah, it's pretty cool. You also have data classes, which are really nice. They're kind of like tuples. They have a lot of interesting hashing and equality operators on them, as well as representation ones. They can be frozen, so they can be mutable or immutable, all sorts of things, so, kind of like enumeration, named tuple tuple, it's stuff all brought together. It's sort of a derivative of the adders project, but they decided not to move adders into the framework because it's evolving quickly and they don't want to, like, freeze it, so, data classes are kind of the same thing.
 
00:24:37 MEDINA: I just want to point out that data classes has a back port for 3.6 so you can go ahead and start using those in 3.6 as long as you pip install them first.
 
00:24:45 KENNEDY: Yeah, how do I get that? I would pip install dataclasses?
 
00:24:48 MEDINA: Pip install dataclasses.
 
00:24:48 KENNEDY: Oh, that's pretty killer, I didn't know about that. All right, so there's a new breakpoint function, which we talked about, we don't use that much, because if you just fire up PyCharm, who cares? But there's some pretty, it's got it when you click in the gutters, but, there's actually some pretty interesting ways to like, say, hook a remote debugger to your code, things like that, there's really interesting stuff going on there. Asyncio got better, Cris, you should be happy about that.
 
00:25:13 MEDINA: Did you see these? Some of this is pretty cool.
 
00:25:16 KENNEDY: Tell me about it.
 
00:25:17 MEDINA: This asyncio run function is a way of running a co-routine from synchronous code, which, I mean, that existed before, but you had to do like 50 million things to set your stuff up correctly, and make sure you didn't break other...
 
00:25:28 KENNEDY: I just called run, and it will internally create the loop and do it for you.
 
00:25:31 MEDINA: Yep, just call run, starts the co-routine.
 
00:25:33 KENNEDY: Oh, that is sweet!
 
00:25:36 MEDINA: It starts an event loop, runs your co-routine, and closes the event loop at the end, so you're going to have to be careful when you use this, but this is pretty cool, and there's some of the task management stuff that's also a little bit better, so this is pretty cool, I'll have to, maybe I'll write a post on this.
 
00:25:52 KENNEDY: Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, definitely, cool. Another one that's really nice is the time module, and a bunch of other functions as well have become more accurate, especially over long durations, and they've taken on nanosecond resolution, so you can type import time, you can say time, you usually call time, and that'll give you a floating point value of the number of seconds since the epoch, like 1970, but this, you can also now in 3.7 say time_ns, and it'll give you the nanoseconds as an integer and because of it's an integer and not a float, that means there's no drift or anything, in sort of the floating point operations, it's like truly the nanoseconds, which is awesome.
 
00:26:32 MEDINA: Yep.
 
00:26:32 KENNEDY: All right, and then finally I just want to close out, give it like, what would a Python Bytes show be without a shout out to Anthony Shaw, right, Brian?
 
00:26:39 OKKEN: Yeah, he's been a part of this show a lot, so.
 
00:26:42 KENNEDY: For sure. So, he actually did a brand new course on Pluralsight called What's New In Python 3.7? So I put a link to his course there as well, and actually, he, it's only about an hour long, but it goes really in-depth into like the advantages or all these various things, so, quite cool, if, and that's easy for you to check out, go ahead and drop over there and check out Anthony's course, very nice. Yeah, so I'm really excited for when this ships. I think it's going to be great. There always seems to be like some latency on the Linux distributions and stuff, before I can really make use of it, but, you know, pretty soon, I'll be happy to be running this.
 
00:27:16 OKKEN: Yeah, definitely.
 
00:27:16 KENNEDY: Yeah, do you guys have any extra news that you want to cover? That's it for our official items.
 
00:27:20 OKKEN: I've been doing a lot of going back, went through all of the code that was in the pytest book to make sure it's 3.7 compatible, which I was happy to find out that it's fine.
 
00:27:33 KENNEDY: Nice.
 
00:27:33 OKKEN: So that's good.
 
00:27:34 KENNEDY: Yeah, very cool.
 
00:27:35 OKKEN: I saw this really cool, like, tutorial series about Mongo. Do you know anything about this?
 
00:27:42 KENNEDY: Man, we spent an incredible amount of time working on this project, yeah, so, I did a three part, three hour webcast series in partnership with MongoDB, and basically, from concept to actually deploying it on DigitalOcean, actually, I rebuilt the PyPI.org website in MongoDB and then published it to the Internet, which I then deleted so I don't have to pay to keep it running, because there's a real one, but, yeah, there's like, it's recorded. People can check it out, you got the link in the show notes, so that's awesome.
 
00:28:11 OKKEN: Yeah, nice, and it looks pretty fun.
 
00:28:14 KENNEDY: Yeah, thanks for the shout out. Cris, anything you want to let people know about, while you're here?
 
00:28:16 MEDINA: Nope. I don't have anything new. Maybe just, keep an eye out for a few new posts coming up in tryexceptpass.org my new blog.
 
00:28:26 KENNEDY: Awesome, yeah, there might be one about this asyncio.run, huh?
 
00:28:27 MEDINA: Yeah, awesome.
 
00:28:30 OKKEN: Yeah, you called it out, you've got to write it now, so.
 
00:28:34 KENNEDY: Remember, the Internet is written in ink, and so, this is permanent now.
 
00:28:39 MEDINA: My next post was going to be about one of my modules which uses asyncio a bunch, so maybe I'm going to go back and experiment with 3.7 and what changes I would have to do there to write it up, so.
 
00:28:51 OKKEN: Pretty cool.
 
00:28:51 KENNEDY: Yeah, awesome. Well, Cris, thanks for being on the show, and Brian, thank you as always.
 
00:28:55 OKKEN: Yeah, thank you.
 
00:28:55 MEDINA: Thanks for having me.
