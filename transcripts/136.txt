00:00:00 KENNEDY: Hello, and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds. This is Episode 136, recorded June 19, 2019. I'm Michael Kennedy.
 
00:00:10 OKKEN: And I'm Brian Okken.
 
00:00:11 KENNEDY: And this episode is brought to you by Data Dog. Check them out at pythonbytes.fm/datadog, get a cool shirt, more on that later. Brian, how you've been?
 
00:00:18 OKKEN: I am doing well.
 
00:00:19 KENNEDY: Good, good, same here. Rollin' into summer, kids are home. Working from home is now chaos, but it's all right.
 
00:00:26 OKKEN: Yeah, it's a little cooler today too, it's nice.
 
00:00:28 KENNEDY: Yeah, it's beautiful. So you've got some kind of magic trick lined up for us for this first one? What's going on here?
 
00:00:34 OKKEN: Well, actually, I think it's just going to be me trying to pronounce a French word, so. I think, is it? I know it's not voy-la. Val-la, voi-la? Do you pronounce the V?
 
00:00:44 KENNEDY: Viola.
 
00:00:46 OKKEN: I don't know.
 
00:00:46 KENNEDY: Voila, I think so.
 
00:00:47 OKKEN: Voila.
 
00:00:47 KENNEDY: Vi-o-la, no.
 
00:00:51 OKKEN: Voila is a new project, it's a newly announced project from the Jupyter notebook people.
 
00:00:56 KENNEDY: Cool.
 
00:00:56 OKKEN: So the idea is Jupyter notebooks in standalone applications or dashboards. So people that are used to working with notebooks and they want to share what they found with other people, and you want to have people be able to interact within and have it be a little bit interactive, but not allow people to change your code, how do you do that? That's where Voila steps in. It's a pretty cool project. I was playing with it a little bit. You can have, or just this reading about it, custom widgets to set up your page, and even like templates and grid layouts. But you don't have to be a web developer. It's like drag-and-drop stuff.
 
00:01:34 KENNEDY: This is cool.
 
00:01:35 OKKEN: I like the idea of presenting the interactive plots and graphs and stuff, and also being able to have people be able to run the code, and do selectors and things, but not let people change the code, so that's pretty cool.
 
00:01:50 KENNEDY: Yeah and you just take your notebook, and you just turn it into a web application. That's pretty awesome. And it has a nice restrictions like does not permit execution of arbitrary code by consumers of the dashboard. It's language-agnostic so you could have C++ code up there in addition to Python or whatever you know, Jupyter does. That's pretty sweet.
 
00:02:08 OKKEN: Yeah, I could see a lot of people using this. Even for Jet Dashboards, for like peeking into databases and stuff.
 
00:02:14 KENNEDY: Nice, so Voila, and you have a website.
 
00:02:16 OKKEN: Voila.
 
00:02:17 KENNEDY: I have the Jupyter notebook and here it is, cool, awesome. So I don't think we covered this. I kind of try to sort of intentionally didn't want to go too far into it because it didn't seem super productive. But there was a presentation back at the Language Summit called Python, something like Cleaning Up Python's Dead Batteries or something to that effect. Did you catch that? So the idea was there is some modules and parts of Python that are outdated. Their existence puts pressure on the core developers in ways that doesn't let them focus on what they need to be doing. It also makes it super hard for people to contribute like for example, there's a Colorsys module in Python in the Standard Library. Yeah, I'm going to pick on this thing a lot during this little segment. And it has the very important purpose of converting CSS colors between coordinate systems. Super important to have that in the Standard Library, right? I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. At one point, Python Standard Library was really the goal of it was to come with everything you need because installing extra stuff like downloading it, getting it in, like running the setup and all that was really tricky. Right, now everything's pip install or one away. So like it looks a little bit weird and if I say you wanted to fix or change the Colorsys module, it's not the same as if you want to go contribute to some random thing on GitHub, no, you've got to be a core developer, there's a lot of steps to go through this, it only ships every 16 months, sorry 18 months, for new content and new things, changes. So how much do you really care to make a contribution, or change the Colorsys, right? Probably not very much for all those reasons, right? It's slow on purpose, it's hard to make changes to and so on, but the problem is like it has things like Colorsys, that probably don't make a lot of sense to be there anymore. So Amber Brown and some other folks were making a case that maybe we should take some stuff away and it was pretty controversial, there was some like heated disagreements at the actual presentation and stuff and I don't care about that, I don't want to go into it. But that approach was we have stuff in Python that maybe shouldn't be there, or let's talk about what we can take out. And Glyph wrote a cool article called, Toward A Kernel Python, and I've talked about this before, I don't know if I talked about it on Python Bytes, or on Talk Python, but I think there should be some kind of subset of Python that is defined to be like the minimum subset of Python that is guaranteed to be everywhere. So for example, if you work with PyPy, you get one variant of mostly Python, if you work with CircuitPython, or MicroPython, you get another variant of mostly Python, but not all of it, right? If you work with Brython or some of the Javascript versions that run in the browser again, similar subset but not the same. So if we have like a smaller sort of essential Python standard language definition and library. That was like, I don't know what's the right number but a smaller amount that you could guarantee was identical across all those platforms. And then opt in to bring other stuff in. So Glyph's main idea was like, could we say instead of like, take what we have and hack away a few things that don't make sense. Rather trim it down to this kernel, to this essence. And then, I don't know pip install the rest of the libraries. Or something like that. The rest of the standard library, you want the networking stack. You pip install networking, I don't know. Like I'm just making up parts that we would do that for. But that was his idea, that basically there's a PEP, PEP 594 that's about removing obviously obsolete and dead stuff from the standard library. And that's all well and good but it actually turns out that having things like Colorsys in the standard library mean that the core devs have to deal with a bunch of stuff. So he talked about, he runs Twisted, so he talks about like how is Twisted doing, like keeping up with PRs and let's look at CPython over there. They have 429 tickets currently awaiting review over in GitHub. I think it's in GitHub. It says the oldest PR awaiting review hasn't been touched since February 2nd 2018. It's almost 500 days old. But when you look at it, the PRs, there's 25 PRs that are out unaddressed whatever. 14 were about the standard library and 10 were about CPython. So why are the core devs having to deal with this stuff when there's typically a replacement? Like there's a built in HTTP library, but people just use Requests. Or aiohttp or whatever right? Like there should be a way to maybe create this essence of it and then bring more in. What do you think?
 
00:07:07 OKKEN: I definitely think there's an idea there. Like the, like you said there's kind of like a Venn Diagram. There's a common set that most people need or, you'll need for lots of different domains. But then, for a web domain, for web stuff, you're going to need different stuff then for like, working with audio files. Or working with text files or the different problem domains are going to use different bits and you don't need everything else. Interesting idea. The install that they had a beginners install stuff is an interesting, how do you deal with that though?
 
00:07:42 KENNEDY: Yeah absolutely. And he does address that and I do think it's it is a challenge. He says look probably the stuff you go get when you download off python.org or you brew install Python, that probably should just be everything, right? But it doesn't mean that it can't be comprised of smaller things that potentially ship on a different schedule.
 
00:08:04 OKKEN: If you're in the install, like Visual Studio or something like that, you always have options of do you want to install this stuff and this other stuff also. You can opt out and we could do something similar to that with Python. Like do you want to install the, the web stuff, do you want to install the audio stuff. Whatever.
 
00:08:20 KENNEDY: Right. You could have these full distributions that you install, but if you look and say Linux for example, if you go to an empty Ubuntu machine and you try to create a virtual environment, depending on the version you have, it may not work. You may get an error that says, you need to apt install python3-venv. It's like wait, that part of Python wasn't shipped? Okay well we'll do that. Or if you try to even pip install something. It might say, you might have to apt install python3-pip, right? So they've already done this on Linux. There's other examples as well. For example the .NET Core in the Microsoft space basically is like this right? Like there's you use their package management system to bring in like significant parts of what is their standard library. I do think it's a problem for beginners. I think it makes it harder, right? It's like saying, why don't we just run Javascript over in Node and it's easy, but then you see all this require JS and all these like patterns. You're like why is this so hard? What happened to print Hello World? You know like, I do think there's a danger, but if the standard way that people get Python is they get this big bundle. But maybe those bundles are not all maintained by the same team. Which is the core developers right? Maybe if they could be broken apart and brought back together through something like pip. And then more importantly upgraded. Like, sooner than every 18 months. That seems like a good idea. And this seems like a way better approach than saying well what can we hack out of the system? Could we hack out Colorsys? Yes or no, let's talk about that.
 
00:09:53 OKKEN: Well right, and also just there's some stuff like Colorsys, it's surprising that it needs to be there. And then there's stuff that's not in the core or in the standard library that... Like why is that not there? Setup tools and Wheel. I'm always surprised that I have to pip install wheel to create a Wheel.
 
00:10:09 KENNEDY: Yeah speaking of pip, Glyph did mention that, when you get Python, it comes with pip. Like installing Python let's you type pip, install a thing. But pip is actually maintained by a different group and shipped on a different cycle. Right that's PyPA, not the core developers for example. So it's like that a little bit, but if it was more like that, you could make a change you could join the team for I don't know, the networking or Colorsys or whatever you want. Work on that and maybe push changes more rapidly then the core CPython runtime.
 
00:10:40 OKKEN: Right we can do something like the PyPy but do like the Python standard library authority or something like that.
 
00:10:46 KENNEDY: Yeah exactly. It's a pretty interesting idea and it definitely seems better than, seems more like the outcome will be better than trying to just hack away at a few dead batteries, if you will.
 
00:10:56 OKKEN: Yeah cool.
 
00:10:57 KENNEDY: This next one that you're talking about, I recently ran into this as an error and I'm like wait what did I type wrong? Then I realized, hey this might be a cool feature. Why don't you tell people about this?
 
00:11:05 OKKEN: Like for instance with PyTest, it comes as a stand alone script. You can just write pytest in the command line. But you can also say, Python -m pytest. And a lot of pip install able things you can do that. You can say -m the thing name and it works. I didn't know how to do this actually. I never really thought, how do I do this and how do I figure it out? And all it is, is to put a a dunder main file in your project. I didn't know it was that easy. So I'm linking to an article that pretty much says we use the convention of, if dunder name equals dunder main then run the main program or something. But you can use the __main__.py file itself in your project and that -m thing just works.
 
00:11:52 KENNEDY: And that's pretty simple right?
 
00:11:53 OKKEN: I'm like, it can't really be that easy. So this morning I did a little flit project. A flit based project. And then threw a dunder main in there with just the print statement. And installed it and went somewhere else and sure enough, it works just awesome, so.
 
00:12:08 KENNEDY: Neat, yeah that's super cool. Yeah I ran across this by accidentally saying Python and saying run a directory instead of a file. I'm like oh. It said it couldn't find __main__.py and like wait. It was looking for it? That's pretty cool. Maybe there's something to be done here, yeah that's great, I'm glad you pointed that out.
 
00:12:27 OKKEN: If you have a dunder main in there you could just say like Python and the directory name and it works.
 
00:12:33 KENNEDY: I have not verified that, but it seems like the error message would indicate that it might work yeah. I mean it was like a full path. It wasn't just the standard directory either. Yeah so, pretty cool.
 
00:12:44 OKKEN: Neat. I don't know how useful it is to people but I'll run it across every once in a while.
 
00:12:49 KENNEDY: Yeah that and entry points, always really nice. Now speaking of nice, Data Dog is supporting our show and they got some nice products so let me tell you about them really quickly. And so, their a cloud scale monitoring platform that unifies metrics, logs, traces, all that kind of stuff. Monitors your Python apps in real time, helps you find bottle necks with detailed flame graphs, trace requests as they cross over service boundaries. All right so if you have microservices, you're talking to the database, or queuing, things like that. Plus it also does automatic instrumentation for popular frameworks like Django, asyncio and Flask so you can quickly get started without too much setup. So, get started today there's a 14 day free trial at pythonbytes.fm/datadog. And you get a cool Data Dog t-shirt which is always fun. Thanks to Data Dog.
 
00:13:37 OKKEN: Mines a nice purple color and my kids always comment when I wear it. They like the shirt.
 
00:13:41 KENNEDY: Yeah I love it. So this next one I want to talk about, the name might sound a little derogatory but it's not really meant that way. Maybe simplistic sounds better but the thing I want to talk about is this article by Chris Wellens entitled The CPython Byte Compiler is Dumb. Simplistic is maybe better but what you might not know depending on how much you dig into it is, there's excruciatingly small amounts of optimization when CPython runs your code. So there's a compilation step actually. Right, the bytecode compiler talks about some kind of compilation. So when you run your code you probably see the dunder py cache folders and then there you have the pyc files. So that's taking your source code turning it into bytecode and put it there. But then instead of say compiling that onto machine instructions, the interpreter takes that, feeds it through ginormous switch statement that's like 3,000 lines long in the CPython run time. And it just goes well what case is this? We're jumping to that right? It's pretty wild, there's a file called ceval.c, check it out. However, there's very little optimization that happens here. So Chris decided to compare this against Lua and one other similar, maybe Ruby, I can't remember what the other one that he compared it against was. But he talked about you know, like if I write this code, what happens to it? So there are optimizations like work called Peephole optimizations and a few memory allocation optimizations in CPython but they're pretty limited. So, if you look at some examples, like let's take an example where we have a function. It's called foo. Defines two variables, X equals zero, Y equals one, return X. That seems simple right Brian?
 
00:15:23 OKKEN: Yeah, except for Y's not needed, but yeah sure.
 
00:15:26 KENNEDY: Exactly so, when you see that, if Y is unused and this is not making any change, it's just literally creating a variable which is effectively an entry in you know, like a module name look up or a locals look up right? Like why does that need to be done? Doesn't seem like a whole lot's happening. So for example, the CPython bytecode compiler could just go well forget that line. And it could say well, X never changes it's value. So why don't we just inline that to say basically the whole function is return zero, right? Inline the X, drop the Y it's good to go. But if you go in through that into the disassembler, you see that no that's not what happens. It literally just takes it step by step by step. Wild right? So it loads the constant, it stores it into field called X. It loads the constant, it stores a different field called Y, then it loads the constant again. A value for X again and then it calls return val as the bytecode instructions. Right and so they're just load constant zero, return value right? Like it could be a lot quicker. So I find that this is, it's honestly a little bit surprising. I mean Python is 25 years old. And it doesn't take steps like this. Now, Darius Beacon did point out that Guido himself said, Python is about having the simplest, dumbest compiler imaginable. And there's some links to that, some references there if you want to go check that out. So I think, maybe it's by design to keep it simple. It's easy for people to contribute to. But it certainly seems like there could be a layer like between parsing the bytecode and executing the bytecode that says, we're not running a debugger or something like that so, let's go crazy and like, just you know, convert stuff like that to return zero. There's also a bunch of other interesting examples in there. There's just one that's really obvious that's good for talking.
 
00:17:19 OKKEN: And optimization levels is something that CS people have been doing with compilers for a long time. So it's not, it's not like we'd have to invent it ourselves.
 
00:17:27 KENNEDY: Right. Yeah, yeah, C has had plenty of it. C#, the Jit compiled languages, their Jit compilers, the place where a lot of that happens. Things like this right?
 
00:17:36 OKKEN: Did you say that there was a comparison to other other languages? Do other languages do more optimization?
 
00:17:42 KENNEDY: No not really. They're all pretty much the same. For better or worse they're all the same. So there's an interesting point he makes that I do want to like just comment on real quick, he says, so the consensus seems to be that if you want or need better performance, don't use Python. Go use another language.
 
00:18:01 OKKEN: No, no, no, no.
 
00:18:02 KENNEDY: I'm like dude no, you were like so close. You were so close as well. You could, maybe don't use CPython right? Maybe use PyPy, P-Y-P-Y. But, the most obvious optimization to me that just can change the game is Cython. You write like one or two slow functions in Cython and boom it goes to machine instructions. And it's near the speed of C. So, I like the article, I don't like that it says, oh if things are a little bit slow just run away. Like no, there's probably a package that has a C extension that already works better or you know, there's a data structure you should be using that would be better. Or there's Cython or, you know, on and on. There's a lot of improvements before Python's not the answer.
 
00:18:43 OKKEN: Or be aware that this is doing this and do your own optimizations or, and for the most part, user profiler and a really tell where the optimization needs to be.
 
00:18:53 KENNEDY: Exactly. Like only 10 percent of your code needs to be fast. At all. If that much most of the time, right? It's usually like one little bit. Like I hope, if this were faster it would change the game.
 
00:19:03 OKKEN: Yeah, I mean I learned assembly in college and I'm glad I've never had to use it.
 
00:19:09 KENNEDY: For sure. So final comment here, Brett Cannon when I interviewed him recently, you know he's on the steering counsel, core developer and so on. He did talk about you know how would adoption of Python 3 change. How would adoption of Python in general change. If we could make Python 2 or 4 times faster than it is today. Like most of the time it doesn't matter, but if it could be faster in some interesting ways what would that mean right? In terms of upgrading more quickly to the new versions and just in general. Like people not saying, oh I have to use Go, because I need asyncio or something like this. So, it seems like if the compiler is this absent, if optimizations are this absent from the compiler, Like there's some low hanging fruit to like do some simple CS compiler optimizations and make stuff faster. Right I mean, you could make this silly foo method like probably three times as fast. Right cause, you could drop most of the bytecode operations.
 
00:20:07 OKKEN: Yeah, definitely. It's worth looking at. Let's, it's interesting that there are some, some people thinking about performance.
 
00:20:15 KENNEDY: Yeah, I mean we had that conversation around the idea of Rust and maybe what if we used Rust instead of C in certain situations. But like this seems like low hanging fruit already right here. And regardless of whether it lands in Rust or C, when it's executed not executing code is a lot faster than executing it. Cool, what's the next one?
 
00:20:33 OKKEN: EdgeDB is something that came up on my radar a couple years ago. I saw that EdgeDB people had a booth at one of the PyCons and they were talking about it but at the time it wasn't around for people to actually play with so, the other day I saw an article called A Path to a 10X Database put out by the EdgeDB people. One there was a download link which I was happy for. There's an alpha 1 available. And people that are following along getting kind of excited about what they're doing, they've published a road map of the features they have done, what they're working on, and it's kind of cool. I'm looking forward to be able to play with it more. So people that don't know what it is, they call it a next generation relational database. It's based on Postgres. I don't know what that means, if they're using Postgres or if they're, used the design of Postgres as a base. I haven't dug that far. But it features a different kind of data model and an advanced query language. And there are a whole bunch of features built into it already. And I'm pretty excited about a lot of it. But the thing that really excites me is that they completely replaced SQL, the query language. It's a different kind of language and it looks more natural to me. I mean people aren't really writing SQL a lot of times because they're using like what the SQLAlchemy or something like that. And partly those things exist because people don't want to write SQL. But maybe, maybe if we had a better query language you wouldn't need the middle layer so much.
 
00:22:08 KENNEDY: Yeah it definitely looks interesting. I don't have a real good sense of what it, like how it compares to both of those. The query syntax does look nice, like the joins look super cool. Or the sub querys possibly as more of like an analogy but, yeah it looks, it looks really neat. It sort of sells itself as a hybrid between document databases like Mongo and relational ones like Postgres. So, yeah it's cool to see innovation there for sure.
 
00:22:35 OKKEN: Outside of Mongo, seeing some innovation on the SQL side, or the relational side is nice. We'll see if it's really a 10X improvement. But yeah, we can't just stick around for nothing. I did actually try to play with it. 'Cause I'm like, I want to play with this. 'Cause it's got Python bindings, but I couldn't get it to install on my Mac so. Eh.
 
00:22:55 KENNEDY: Yeah well. Which you have to suffer for being out on the cutting edge Brian. The price you pay.
 
00:23:01 OKKEN: Yep.
 
00:23:02 KENNEDY: All right so this last one is going to be just a quick round up of some stuff. Maybe this combo will help some folks. This guy, Jacques Jonas worked for a software sorry healthcare startup in the US. And he wrote this cool blog post called 16 python libraries that helped a healthcare start up grow.
 
00:23:22 OKKEN: Oh neat.
 
00:23:22 KENNEDY: Yeah so it's just like a paragraph or two about different packages or even modules that they used to kind of solve some problem within their startups, so. So we have Paramiko which lets you basically issue commands over SSH to other servers. So like on my computer I could like use Python and talk over SSH to run processes or copy file stuff between servers. Anything I can SSH to, that's pretty cool. The built in CSV module. You know, that's always good for parsing CSV files really nice. He mentioned SQLAlchemy, so they use SQLAlchemy as well. Requests and Beautifulsoup for APIs and web scraping. I'd like to say that every website is an API, even if it doesn't know it. So if it doesn't have an API, it has data and you just have to do the right request to it. Now it's an API. Here's one for you Brian, Test Scenarios, which is a Pyunit extension for dependency injection. So, that's kind of cool. Dependency injection is not that huge of a thing that people make use of in Python but, you know, it has it place I guess. HL7. So a simple library for parsing. Health Left Level Seven files into Python objects. That's cool, I suppose like doing that yourself probably is not fun. So having a library that does it is great. Python Phone Numbers with is a library for parsing, formatting and validating international phone numbers. That's pretty sweet. That's based on a Google library. It's like a Python port of it. Gevent for networking and asynchronous code. Python-Dateutil for parsing datetimes like anytime I have to work with day times I'm like okay, this project now requires Python-Dateutil because parsing datetime sucks without it right? But this one you can say par as in like that right answer just seems always to come out, that's great. So Matplotlib for graphs. Python Magic, have you heard of Python Magic?
 
00:25:18 OKKEN: I don't know.
 
00:25:19 KENNEDY: I hadn't. And so what you can do is you can give it a file, some random binary file or even text file and it'll tell you what file type it is.
 
00:25:27 OKKEN: Oh neat.
 
00:25:28 KENNEDY: So like suppose somebody gives you an image, and they've named it .jpg but it's really a png. Like you could feed it something, to something like Python Magic, it would say png. So you can give it like PDFs or Zip files and it'll tell you like what file it is.
 
00:25:43 OKKEN: Okay but, Magic? That seems like a bad name for it.
 
00:25:47 KENNEDY: It's Python Magic. Well I mean, the reason is it's based on a thing called Lib Magic. But yeah, it's just like the criticism just transitively follows to Lib Magic I guess. All right another one, Django obviously. That doesn't need a lot of introduction but, yeah they must do Django. Boto which is the API for interacting with all things AWS. So if you're doing anything with that, that's super cool. Like I use Boto for automatic transcoding, like reencoding in different formats, videos for my courses or, downloading say MP3s to a caching server, stuff like that. And then finally, Mailgun for sending email into Python API for sending, both those for sending reminders. One over email, one over text. But that's kind of a cool combo of things right?
 
00:26:32 OKKEN: Mailgun's just a great name. We've been starting to use Paramiko at work too for the SSH features. It's good.
 
00:26:38 KENNEDY: Oh yeah, nice. Yeah I just, I feel like this you know, like you know I don't actually have to pick what he picked but it's cool to see just how those all fit together. And think of like well, you know what packages run this company basically.
 
00:26:51 OKKEN: Articles like this are neat. Like different people solving different problems. What are they using from Python?
 
00:26:56 KENNEDY: Yeah exactly. Like all right so, that's it for our main items. Got any extras you want to share with us?
 
00:27:01 OKKEN: Uh no, do you?
 
00:27:03 KENNEDY: I thought I didn't, but I'm going to share one thing with you all. I just recorded an episode with the United States Digital Service for Talk Python.
 
00:27:11 OKKEN: Oh okay. What is that?
 
00:27:12 KENNEDY: I hadn't heard of that either. But this is like a little stealth start up type thing inside the government. President Obama set it up and it was basically, the tech team brought in to solve the healthcare.gov crashing problems. Like that whole big fail to launch for the Obama Care stuff. There was a group of people brought in to fix it and then they did. They're like well, why can't we just apply this to all the other broken things in the government? So it's a, it's a really cool service where like you can go do like a three month tour of duty at the US Digital Service and like not even have to leave your job. Just take like unpaid leave to, you go fix something in the government or whatever. It's pretty cool, I have an episode coming out but, I hadn't heard of it and I thought that was kind of cool so I thought I'd throw it out there.
 
00:27:53 OKKEN: Yeah, that is neat.
 
00:27:54 KENNEDY: It is for sure. I have a, it's almost a joke. It's not exactly a joke, it's more maybe mocking. But, how can you tell the difference between machine learning and AI, Brian?
 
00:28:06 OKKEN: I don't know.
 
00:28:07 KENNEDY: If it's written in Python, it's probably machine learning. If it's written in PowerPoint, it's probably AI.
 
00:28:14 OKKEN: What? Really, a PowerPoint?
 
00:28:17 KENNEDY: Like as in, it's just like a presentation with ideas but no code and no implementation yet.
 
00:28:22 OKKEN: Oh okay, yeah okay. Got it.
 
00:28:25 KENNEDY: So basically if it's real, it's machine learning. If it's, if it's like, we're going to use magic, computer magic to solve this problem it's AI and it's in PowerPoint.
 
00:28:34 OKKEN: That's funny. I have a question for you. It's not a joke. Way back in the dark ages when I was going to college, all the AI work was done in like Lisp.
 
00:28:43 KENNEDY: Yes it was.
 
00:28:44 OKKEN: Are there still people doing AI in Lisp or is that not a thing anymore? Do you know?
 
00:28:48 KENNEDY: I think people are still doing it. But I don't think neural network people... Have stayed there right? I think the neural network people mostly have moved to Python and things like TensorFlow. And other GP based things. But I'm sure that there's like, different kinds of AI. Yeah 'cause you're right, it was all, you had to be a Lisp programmer if you wanted to do anything with AI. And the AI was always this like, amorphous weird thing. Like you don't really know what it is but, probably if we can like set up a blind chat with it over IRC, then it might seem like it's alive and then it'll be AI. Right, like that? You know, the whole turing test and all that stuff. And now it's all like, that's cute. Car. Drive here. The car won't go out. That's what Python and like TensorFlow and the Lisp on that's doing the chat. I feel like that's kind of where it is, but I'm sure people are still doing cool stuff with Lisp that I don't know or really want to read the code for.
 
00:29:49 OKKEN: Okay, I'm glad there's probably not any Lisp programmers that listen to this.
 
00:29:52 KENNEDY: I know, but we're probably going to be posted in a negative way on some Lisp forum, sorry about that. Sorry. All right well, thanks for being here Brian and thanks for sharing everything.
 
00:30:01 OKKEN: Thank you.
 
00:30:01 KENNEDY: You bet. Bye everyone.
 
00:30:02 OKKEN: Bye.
