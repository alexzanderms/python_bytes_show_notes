00:00:00 OKKEN: Hello and welcome to Python Bytes, where we deliver Python news in the headlines directly to your earbuds. This is Episode 150, recorded September 25th, 2019. I'm Brian Okken.
 
00:00:11 KENNEDY: And I'm Michael Kennedy.
 
00:00:12 OKKEN: And this episode is brought to you by Datadog, check them out at pythonbytes.fm/datadog. More on what they have to offer later. But Michael, right now I kind of sense a theme. Are you looking for a new job? Are you hiring somebody? What's going on?
 
00:00:27 KENNEDY: I'm going to cover a couple of topics about getting better interviews. You know, I kind of hope I never have to apply for a job or go to a job again in my life. So no, I'm not actually on the hunt for that. But I do have a couple of friends who are looking for jobs, and I'm just a little sympathetic to the challenges and whatnot, so, I want to kick us off with a thing called, How to Stand Out in the Python Coding Interview. This comes from James Timmins, and he wrote it on realpython.com. So it's kind of a Python version of the stuff that it seems like the tech industry thinks you should know, and I feel like it's a little bit better. I feel like the tech industry says, "Which is better, a bubble sort or a quicksort?" You know what? I don't care, I call sort on the list and we're good. You know, I don't, maybe sorted, you could debate .sort versus sorted, but who cares, right? This is not a problem we need to keep solving. And yet, it feels like in the interview process it falls back to, they asked about Big O notation, and they asked about algorithms of that type, they asked about a data structure, like, when would I use a doubly linked list versus a singly linked list, and like, ahhhh. I can go build a Python web app with SQLAlchemy and talk to Stripe and charge a credit card, but I forgot when I use a singly linked list, right? Single direction linked list. But that seems like what people are testing. So here's an article that sort of covers those kinds of questions, but specifically for the Python developer. And I think it's pretty, pretty decent. So it's meant to help you kind of navigate that space of Python, and show you that you have some knowledge of the built-ins and of the language, and things like that, and you can kind of write decent code. So, it covers a handful of things with a bunch of other stuff mixed in there. So how to use enumerate to iterate both over a view of collection, to iterate both with indices and values, and if you've been doing Python for a long time, that's obvious, we do that a lot, but if you come from a language like C++, or Java or something that doesn't have this, all of a sudden, well, then it's really weird and you don't know to use it. So it's good to have that in there. Debugging with breakpoints, formatting with f-strings, F yes for that one, that's great, sorting lists, I talked about that, you don't have to care about the algorithms but knowing how to sort stuff is really nice; generators and its pressure on memory, default values and dictionaries, using the Counter class, and then just some standard library stuff. I think knowing all those things kind of puts a nice Python spin on that level of Python interviewing. Do you do any interviewing?
 
00:03:19 OKKEN: I haven't actually applied for a job for several years.
 
00:03:22 KENNEDY: Do you do it in reverse though, do you do hiring, like interview people for their...
 
00:03:23 OKKEN: Yes. Yeah, definitely a lot. And I help but with other teams too, in their hiring. For some reason, people know me as this person that knows Python, so I'll do the Python interview part. But yeah, a lot of this stuff is stuff that I look for, if you actually say, "for i in length," the interviews over. You don't know Python then.
 
00:03:44 KENNEDY: Yeah, I think maybe if you're hiring for, I'm hiring a developer, they don't have to know Python, but they're going to be doing it so we're going to help them along. If they're really good at Java, you could probably mentor them over, but if your goal is to hire an experienced Python developer, and they don't know, for item in collection, yeah, you're done.
 
00:04:03 OKKEN: But I'm a pretty fair person, I talk through stuff. People can always recover. If you freeze up, don't worry about it, just flow with it. I think people should interview more, even if they're not looking for a job, just to keep up their interview chops. It's good.
 
00:04:17 KENNEDY: Yeah, nice, I agree.
 
00:04:18 OKKEN: Speaking of being nice to people, we have a bit of news. Even though I didn't even actually know this was an issue. So, there was an announcement made that the PSF, the Python Software Foundation, updated its Code of Conduct. And apparently the PSF had one code of conduct for the PSF and things it was sponsoring, and a different one for PyCon US. And now there's just one. And so, that's the big news. And we've got links to the Code of Conduct and the enforcement guidelines and reporting guidelines. And we hear about codes of conduct occasionally and stuff. And in the past I've thought, why do I have to care about this? I mean, just don't be a jerk, and try to be a nice person, isn't that enough? And for the most part, yes, but if that was all there was to it, and there weren't any problems, then we wouldn't need these. And clearly we need them, things come up. So, I think it's good for people to go, it's not a long read, I think people should read them, especially before you go to an event, to make sure you know what's up with that. The other thing that's nice to look up is, what is the reporting mechanism? So if you see somebody violating these, or basically just somebody being a jerk, what do you do about it? Who do you contact? And so that's good to just sort of, at least have read it once, so that if it happens you can look it up and figure out what to do.
 
00:05:35 KENNEDY: At least tell what it is. And you're kind of putting yourself in a space where you got to know even a little more about it.
 
00:05:41 OKKEN: Right, so one of the things is that, it covers things that the PSF sponsors, also sponsors bases. This includes a couple of different, two or three of the Python meetups around the country. They're not sponsoring us, yet, although we should probably hit them up for that. But we are doing a meetup here in Portland West coming up next month, and yeah, we probably got to think about this, of what to do if something happens. So, Michael and I will probably talk about this before the actual meetup.
 
00:06:10 KENNEDY: Yeah, we'll figure it out. What's the date of the meetup again, for people?
 
00:06:12 OKKEN: Oh my gosh, I should know this. It's like the second Tuesday in October, so that's the sixth or the eighth or something like that?
 
00:06:20 KENNEDY: That would be the eighth.
 
00:06:21 OKKEN: Eighth, yeah.
 
00:06:22 KENNEDY: Awesome. Alright, well, for those of you who can make it, that'd great to see you out there. Alright now, speaking of great stuff, before we get onto more interviewing on my theme here, I want to talk about Datadog. Python Bytes is sponsored by Datadog, through a modern cloud-scale monitoring platform that brings things like metrics, logs, and traces all in one place. Their tracing client includes auto-instrumentation support for things like Django, Flask, Postgres. That means you get visibility into what your entire application is doing, not just maybe a trace out of your Python app, or profiling just your Python. You can troubleshoot slow requests and optimize your code within a few minutes. So start monitoring your dynamic environment with a free trial, and Datadog will send you a free T-shirt as well, just get over to pythonbytes.fm/datadog to get started. So this previous one that I talked about, Brian, it was very much focused on, sort of these, almost these data structure algorithm versions, and it said, here's the Python equivalent of some of these conversations you might have. This next one, I don't know how long it would take you to go through all this stuff, But it would take you a good, long while. This is by Ben Rogojan, I'm going to say. Sorry about that if I got that wrong. Goes by, Seattle Data Guy. so it talks a little bit about some of the silly stuff like FizzBuzz, and some of the traditional, classical silly algorithm problems like, give us the nth Fibonacci et cetera et cetera. And some things that you might study, and so on. But then, there's a bunch of videos, and I don't know how many videos, there are many I would say, at least 75 videos on different topics. These are like 15 minute videos. So there's some on algorithms, there are some on data structures, there's some on Big O notations, dynamic programming, string manipulations, system design, operating systems threads, object-oriented programming, design patterns, SQL and more stuff. So, if you are in the process of trying to learn these things, to get one of these jobs or nail of one of these interviews, you've got homework.
 
00:08:25 OKKEN: Oh okay.
 
00:08:26 KENNEDY: That's a lot.
 
00:08:27 OKKEN: This is frightening though. Yeah, awesome that this resources is here, especially you can pick a part where you had trouble with or maybe after an interview even, and go, "Wow, I got asked this stuff and I didn't understand it. So maybe I got to review it, then." I was just watching all of the different algorithms, sorting algorithms. I love videos of sorting algorithms.
 
00:08:46 KENNEDY: I know, the visualizations. There's a big graphic of 20 different sorting algorithms, all sorting next to each other at the same time. It's mesmerizing. And also, I would say, there are maybe 15 pages of comments, and the comments get kicked off. I think we really need to face a reckoning in our profession. And the reckoning is this. We require an overload of stuff that's simply not important on the job, just to get through the interviewing process and land a position. So basically, you got to go through all these algorithms, kind of like I said, and then in the end, you do a lot of googling on Stack Overflow, and you find packages on Awesome Python, and then you install them and you roll. Right, there's a huge discussion about why that is, what we can do about it, and so on. So I think it's great. You should also check out the conversation in the comments.
 
00:09:35 OKKEN: On the other end of it, just a devil's advocate. One of the reasons I know people do pick up algorithm type questions is because they work in a specific space, domain, and it would be obvious to ask about that. But if they don't really, if they know they can train you on their domain, they have to ask you about stuff that is something generic, and that's where the algorithm stuff is. I still think it's bad. Things like, which should you use, a bubble sort or a quicksort? That's a dumb question. But if you have things like, FizzBuzz is kind of silly, but you should know it by now. And some of the other things, it's hard to come up with good questions that are fair for anybody coming at it. So also, keep in mind that.
 
00:10:19 KENNEDY: What I would much rather see is something live, and in the tooling environment that that person likes to work in. So if I was interviewing somebody, it seems to me that I might set up a Zoom call, and we'd do screen sharing, and say, I would like you to create this kind of website, and have a route that passes data to the view method. Or whatever, right, if it's a web job. Or, I'd like you to have a program that reads a JSON file and prints out these things, and just say, okay now, go, let's do it, talk me through building this app. And spend 15 minutes. You can tell if somebody is comfortable in the language and comfortable in their tools, or they have just no idea. I know that's what FizzBuzz is supposed to solve, but if you can't load a JSON file, which is like, three lines of code, and it just works with dictionaries after that, you probably are not really capable in Python. I would much rather see something like that, like a small task that's not super domain-specific, that's not really deep into some library, that you could ask, over all of these crazy things. And it seems like it'd be effective. So, I don't know, that's my thoughts.
 
00:11:28 OKKEN: Definitely. Cool.
 
00:11:29 KENNEDY: So one thing that I would really hope I don't get asked in interviews is about regular expressions. Because those things are like write only.
 
00:11:38 OKKEN: No, simple regular expressions are fine. In regular expression's defense, they're very useful to concisely say some string kind of matches some other string within, anyway, people know what regular expressions are for, hopefully. If you don't...
 
00:11:55 KENNEDY: They're superpowerful.
 
00:11:56 OKKEN: you should probably look it up.
 
00:11:57 KENNEDY: They're our thing.
 
00:11:59 OKKEN: But one of the hard things though is, I'm going to introduce a project by Anthony Sotille? Sotille? Sotille? Anyway, sorry Anthony.
 
00:12:07 KENNEDY: Sottile
 
00:12:07 OKKEN: Sottile - Sottile, called re-assert. And so what this is, it's just a new matcher that does better tracebacks for when the match fails. And so this is really helpful if you've got, if you want to use regular expressions for a test, for part of your test, for your application. The string should say, "Hello Michael, welcome to my website." And I know that the names going to be different so I'm going to use a regular expression to parse out the name. How do I make sure that that matches, and have a useful answer when it doesn't. And that's where our re-assert comes in. And it's pretty fun. It's a fairly new project so the documentation's a little on the light side, and so I did what I often do with new projects, is I jumped into the test code, and looked at the test code for this to find out how it was used. And it's kind of fun. Like, for instance, we're going to put it in show notes, an example of just matching foo with fob, and if you use just re.match, it just returns as none.
 
00:13:15 KENNEDY: It says no match.
 
00:13:17 OKKEN: Yeah, so it's not going to tell you anything. But if you use the match as object within the re-assert project, it gives you more detail of why it doesn't match. I think this is, for very specific use cases, it's very cool.
 
00:13:34 KENNEDY: I love it, because one of the really frustrating things about regular expressions is, you say, here's the thing and it should match this, and it says, nope, doesn't match. Why don't you match? And this is really cool. So if you compare foo to fob, foo is the regular expression, fob is the value, for static characters, it just matches, just tries to find that substring basically, and the error is, right here at the b, it didn't match, the f matched, the o matched, but the B didn't match, and that's super helpful, that's great.
 
00:14:04 OKKEN: And there's a bunch of examples, especially in the test code. So check it out, and good job, Anthony.
 
00:14:10 KENNEDY: Absolutely. You know, there's a bunch of awesome Python lists these days, Brian. We've got awesome ASGI, we've got Awesome Python applications from Mahmoud, and we've talked a bit about Python type hints, and whatnot, so of course there's an awesome-python-typing awesome list.
 
00:14:30 OKKEN: Okay, nice.
 
00:14:32 KENNEDY: It's a collection of awesome Python types, stubs, plug-ins, and tools for working with them. And so, in terms of the tools, there's the static type checkers, there's stub packages, which define the types that go with other packages, which is pretty interesting, like typeshed. So instead of actually putting the types in the libraries, you can put them in these libraries that go next to your library, and it will actually pull that. It has stuff for Python 3.6, 3.7, standard library, like data classes, and all of those things. So yeah, it's pretty interesting, put them in a pyi file, and it will carry the types over to, there's an example of dataclasses.pyi, that will apply the types to dataclasses.py.
 
00:15:18 OKKEN: Oh, cool.
 
00:15:19 KENNEDY: So it's got a bunch of those, typeshed, is probably the biggest one there. It's got tools. This is a supercategory of many other ones, but one I thought you might like is, pytest-mypy. So mypy static checker plug-in for pytest, I think we covered that one.
 
00:15:32 OKKEN: Yeah, I think so.
 
00:15:34 KENNEDY: Yeah, and then cool articles like how to type check Django, and Django REST framework, so which is a whole tutorial on doing that. Apparently, Django has a bunch of magic, and it makes type checking it extra hard. so there's just a bunch of things like that in there, that I thought people might, if they're getting into this Python typing space, it's a lot of good stuff to go check out.
 
00:15:53 OKKEN: Some of the, like even Linters, because some people, you try one and it's confusing, well try another one, maybe it fits better for what you're doing.
 
00:16:01 KENNEDY: Yeah, there's a bunch of Flake8 and some Black stuff, and things like that in there.
 
00:16:05 OKKEN: Okay, cool. I haven't really worked with stubbs yet. I think that's something I want to try and turn to.
 
00:16:10 KENNEDY: Yeah, same here. What do you got for our last one?
 
00:16:12 OKKEN: Last one... Oh, so we have, actually, in the space of looking at people writing articles and and speaking and stuff, we kind of do that a lot. We run across quite a few people that list Developer Advocate as their job title. and I don't really know exactly what that is, and I've asked a couple of people, and not quite understood it still. You did an entire episode on it, didn't you?
 
00:16:36 KENNEDY: I did, I did. I'm going to see if I can pull up the number, the number is, I'm not sure what the number is. I got to figure it, I'll look, you go ahead.
 
00:16:43 OKKEN: This is from Dustin Ingram, in an article called, Developer Advocacy, Frequently Asked Questions. And the disclaimer he puts is, he is a Developer Advocate for Google, so other companies and other people might experience different things. But first off, just what is it? And he says, he helps represent the Python community at Google, in his case, but really whatever company somebody is working for, tries to get more involved with the Python community and then also try to represent the Python community within the company and represent the company in the community, kind of both ends of it. He has a chance to work on different packages that he cares about, in Dustin's case, he works with the PyPI and with packaging and other things, speaking at conferences of course, that's what we assume, that's what I assume, but there apparently some that don't do, much speaking at conferences, and some the just do one or two a year. Which, that sounds fun. The thing that I think really sounds fun is being the user zero for new products or features for a company.
 
00:17:46 KENNEDY: Yeah, that's pretty cool.
 
00:17:47 OKKEN: With the bent of thinking about Python users and whether or not they like it, and things like that. He's got a whole list of different things that they do, but actually, this sounds like a lot of fun to me. It would be kind of cool.
 
00:17:59 KENNEDY: I think this would be a great job. Yeah, I interviewed a couple of folks back on Talk Python, it was a lot of fun to do that episode. Yeah, I think it sounds like a great job. It's one of those jobs where you get to, you basically get to explore technology, obviously, when you work for one of these companies, it's in the slant of that, so the three people I interviewed, Cecil Phillip from Microsoft, Paul Everett from JetBrains, and Matt Makai from Twilio, they all kind of work around their space. But I think it sounds great, if you just like researching new stuff and playing with new ideas, talking to people, I would definitely do it.
 
00:18:36 OKKEN: I'd kind of assumed, even address the work-life balance, there's some people that do like to travel a lot, so you can do that, and some people that don't. I thought that maybe that was just required for a DA but...
 
00:18:48 KENNEDY: Maybe, I'm not really sure either. But work-life balance is interesting, because a lot of times those folks would be working from home, when they're not gone, they might have more time with their family, more flexibility to go to their kid's soccer game, but then make it up in the evening, whereas people go to the office every day, maybe not so much.
 
00:19:07 OKKEN: Definitely. It depends on your life, right?
 
00:19:09 KENNEDY: That's right. What you call balance? Okay, so do you got any extra stuff you want to share? We already gave a shout out to our Portland West meetup that we're doing by your office.
 
00:19:19 OKKEN: That's all I wanted to shout out. How about you?
 
00:19:21 KENNEDY: Yeah, that's all on meetup.com, so people can check that out. Nothing major, there was some interesting news we covered a while ago, that some of Kenneth Reitz's projects were being moved around, and the biggest domino in that whole space was requests. I can't remember exactly who jumped in, but someone from the PSF jumped in and said, we'll take it, we'll will take care of it in this thing called, some project that the PSF runs, that can take care of these types of projects when they become important in our, teetering on being unowned or whatever. So there's a huge discussion on Reddit about how it actually has moved over. So it actually has moved over to the PSF, for one. And so, now the place for requests on GitHub for example, is github.com/psf/requests. That's wild. but there's a huge discussion around it on Reddit. And, take that for what it is, it's Reddit. It's kind of, you get both sides type of place but I think people find it interesting.
 
00:20:22 OKKEN: I didn't really know that, actually there's quite a bit of stuff, there's a few projects under PSF. I imagine that will grow bigger now.
 
00:20:30 KENNEDY: Yeah, I would think so as well.
 
00:20:31 OKKEN: Black is there. That's interesting.
 
00:20:33 KENNEDY: How interesting. Are you ready for some laughs?
 
00:20:35 OKKEN: I am.
 
00:20:35 KENNEDY: This one might hurt us a little bit. This is good, as in from laughing so hard. This one was called to our attention by Colin Martin, and it's a set of web development merit badges. Go ahead and pull up the link, where you can see the badges, 'cause you got to see the picture that goes along with each badge. Let's take them row by row. Alright, I'll do the first one. They each have a big circle, and its got something in it. this one has a giant A, and it says, so you get this badge if you changed a DNS record and everything worked just fine. And I love this one. There's a /[A-Brain]], and it says, comprehended someone else's RegEx.
 
00:21:16 OKKEN: Yeah, exactly. Definitely.
 
00:21:19 KENNEDY: it just has as a bit of a web bend. Another one is like an expander thing, it says, built an accordion from scratch.
 
00:21:24 OKKEN: I've done that.
 
00:21:25 KENNEDY: I think you've done this next one. the one on the next row.
 
00:21:29 OKKEN: So, :wq, for, exited VIM.
 
00:21:32 KENNEDY: Exited VIM, I love it. Do you want to do the next two?
 
00:21:36 OKKEN: So, Aw CRUD, you get it if you accidentally created your own CMS. And then, a little painter I like the little painter with the acorn hat.
 
00:21:46 KENNEDY: It's like a French design painter.
 
00:21:48 OKKEN: You get this if you pulled off a design you didn't think you could. Well that's actually kind of nice.
 
00:21:53 KENNEDY: It is nice. This next one is for the consultants out there. It's like a mallet banging down, like a judge. And you get this one if you told a client or boss, "No, were not doing that."
 
00:22:04 OKKEN: Yeah, that's awesome.
 
00:22:05 KENNEDY: Then there's one wtih some crazy matching symbols, as you, wrote an HTAccess redirect that included a capture group. And then this one's pretty funny. You have a minus CSS in pink, and a plus CSS, green, and it says you've, refactored a large portion of CSS and you didn't break anything.
 
00:22:23 OKKEN: Oh yeah, that's good. There are some good ones.
 
00:22:26 KENNEDY: You just want to pick out a couple of more? We could do that...
 
00:22:28 OKKEN: Yeah like, merged master into a six month old branch.
 
00:22:32 KENNEDY: I love that one. There's two arrows going sideways two arrows going down, it says, centered an element horizontally and vertically.
 
00:22:39 OKKEN: Nobody can have that one.
 
00:22:40 KENNEDY: That's so hard.
 
00:22:41 OKKEN: It's not possible, I don't think.
 
00:22:43 KENNEDY: I don't think it is either.
 
00:22:46 OKKEN: I like the dude laying down on the ground. It says you, pushed to production on Friday and didn't roll it back over the weekend.
 
00:22:51 KENNEDY: Here's our undecorated one. Had a neglected site get hacked and spammed.
 
00:22:58 OKKEN: Oh yeah, these are...
 
00:23:01 KENNEDY: And then there's another one, there's a guy sleeping on a laptop, it says, solved the bug by taking a nap.
 
00:23:06 OKKEN: That's awesome. There's a semi-colon for, debugged something for over an hour where the fix literally was one character. Awesome.
 
00:23:15 KENNEDY: Yeah, let's leave the rest for the listeners out there to go check out. You just going to to see the pictures, these are brilliant.
 
00:23:20 OKKEN: Yeah, these are great.
 
00:23:22 KENNEDY: The first time I read it, my stomach hurt, it was really good . Alright, the speed was good. This was a fun show, thanks Brian.
 
00:23:31 OKKEN: Thank you.
