00:00:00 Hello, and welcome to Python bytes, where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds. Or in this case, your eyeballs also, this is Episode 210, recorded November 23 2020. And I'm Brian Aachen.

00:00:14 I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:00:15 Yeah. I'm Jay. Hi,

00:00:16 Jay Miller. Welcome to Python

00:00:18 byte, man. I'm glad to be here. I will say this is hard, because coming up with pics for the show that you normally get all your pics from, is quite the challenge.

00:00:30 I have we pulled the rug out from you like normally you would just listen and then go, here we go. But now it's

00:00:35 not gonna live I went to the search page and typed in like my first three pics. And sure enough, they were taken. No, there's 210 episodes. So we just have been recycling them for like the last four months. We

00:00:46 just started with zero and started over again.

00:00:49 Yeah, if people listen like what do we are on episode 40. Again? Funny, we probably could but you know, anyway, only our best fans would know. And Brian, were live streaming as well. We should tell the non live stream listeners that this might be a thing in the future.

00:01:04 Yeah, this might be a thing. Oh, we're gonna see how it goes. It's kind of fun with live streaming right now. But that's boring for people that are listening to us in the future. But anyway, yeah, we'll

00:01:13 put a link and like a way to know when we're live streaming and stuff like that. So yeah, we'll talk more about that later. Yeah,

00:01:19 well, let's start it off. I want to talk about Kickstarter. So you had a Kickstarter campaign once a long time ago, right? I

00:01:25 did. I've actually done three Kickstarter campaigns, one for a bunch of T shirts, which was a ton of work. It was fun. But I shipping thousand shirts or something was quite the deal. Maybe not that many but many shirts. And I did one to start the training company around the Python jumpstart course, which was awesome. And I did one with Matt MCI for the Python for entrepreneurs course. So yeah, I love Kickstarter.

00:01:48 So I think Kickstarter is a pretty cool thing. And so I was interested to see there was an article called the Kickstarter projects, do they succeed? But yes, the success or failure of them is sort of interesting. I really loved that this was an analysis done with Python data science tools. So it looks like I think it's Aditya it was the author. And it looks like this may have been a university project or something, I'm not quite sure. But I guess it doesn't matter. It's pretty cool article. So he used a kaggle information that went that used all the projects up through 2018 I think. So it's not sort of through today, but that's pretty big data set. There's like 370 plus thousand projects in the data set. So that's neat came from kaggle. And then the article goes through using pandas dataframes to explore the data using describe which is a cool thing that dataframes have to just learn. You can learn quite a bit about your data, just with describe. But then he goes on and he uses matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze the data further. And I really, I kind of really liked that. I've seen articles like this before, I've had to use pandas and stuff and graphics to explore data. But this is data, I actually really kind of cared about learning about Kickstarter, I may want to go back and and use some of the some of the techniques that he talked about in this article to kind of explore it more. I gotta point out, there was an interesting line in there that said the data set goes back has a 1970 listing that said the data from 1970 seems to be bad or insignificant data. I wasn't sure if this was just like a misunderstanding of when Kickstarter started or a joke. But yeah, it wasn't around in 1870.

00:03:33 That's not when the solid kickstart my heart came out, is it? Oh,

00:03:37 I don't know that. That was Motley Crue. I think that was like late 80s.

00:03:40 Yeah,

00:03:41 yeah. Yeah.

00:03:43 The, you know, there's a bunch of punch lines. One of the punch lines is 30. About 35% are successful, although they describe success as meeting the goal. And one of the things

00:03:54 funded, right, yeah, not necessarily shipped, deliver the product, right.

00:03:57 Yeah, well, I'm not sure. But one of the things I love about Kickstarter is the feedback. So I personally think that a failed Kickstarter is also a success, because people, people learn that there's not enough demand to push forward. So that's information. And that's successful, too. But, you know, maybe I'm just an optimist.

00:04:14 There's a lot of research that's been done on like the idea of Kickstarter, and how now Kickstarter is almost 80% marketing and 20% product idea. There have been Kickstarters that have failed that have retried on Kickstarter with the different marketing approach. And like wildly succeeded. So interesting. It would be interesting to see like, out of the ones that did succeed, like how many of them had videos, how many, like how long were their posts, because I think a lot of times people want to jump on these projects, like, hey, fund me, please, please give me money. And it's like, you almost have to do a little bit more work than that. to even get to the bare minimum opportunity of success.

00:04:54 I did a lot of research on Kickstarter success and failure and stuff in the early days and yeah, it's there's a whole thing that you don't see about getting the word out about if you get a high enough growth in the early days Kickstarter will feature you like my first one. When I launched my own training, it became for like, two weeks. My Python course, was the number one software product on Kickstarter. And we got like, 40% of the people who bought the course discovered it on Kickstarter, not because I told them about or someone else told them about it. But the reason it got there is the podcast. The podcast listeners who heard about it all went and quickly funded it. So it Kickstarter saw like this trajectory of going up there. And yeah, it works. Well.

00:05:38 I think that's good information, though. Also, I mean, that's, yes, it's marketing. But yes, selling a product is also marketing. It's also having a platform to tell people about it. It's you can't really sell stuff into a vacuum and expect to make money. So

00:05:53 yeah, one really final interesting thought if people are kind of interested in Kickstarter, there's a fantastic movie, one of my favorite documentaries of all time called capital C, capital, the letter C, the movie, you search for that. It's like, it's in it, and I 2015 following people around who got funded and like when Kickstarter was all the brand new rage, and it's just super cool to see those people go through their It's amazing. Go check it out. But you know, what was not super commonly used back then, at least compared to now is using GPUs for machine learning. And high end computation. Like that's a pretty new thing, right? Not brand new, but it's definitely gaining momentum. Yeah, let's hear about it. All right. So often you hear about Oh, you can just do like pi CUDA, this and CUDA, that and CUDA means Nvidia. CUDA is not a general thing. So when something says, you can do this cool machine learning on GPUs with CUDA, and then I look at my MacBook Pro here, that has an AMD, I don't know, 560, whatever graphics card in it, nope, don't get to do CUDA. No CUDA, I actually do have a gaming sim racing computer that has like a Nvidia card if I really wanted to, but the point is, like, a lot of these laptops and other machines don't have some way to run Nvidia stuff on them. Right. And that's, you know, that takes the wind out of the sails of a lot of data science and computational projects, unless you could bring in the Vulcans. So there's an article which talks about a an open source set of libraries, I guess, articles entitled GPU accelerated Python for machine learning on cross vendor graphics cards. That's pretty cool. Yeah. And so apparently, it uses this project called Vulcan compute the Vulcan compute Python framework. And the idea is that a lot of the modern machine learning libraries like Google, TensorFlow, Facebook's pi torch, a bunch of others, they've all been adopting Vulcan, which is a c++ library as their cross platform GPU SDK. So that means Yeah, I can do it on my computer, or I don't have to have Nvidia or whatever, right. So that's really awesome. However, they say, you know, in order to use this Vulcan library is 500 to 2000 lines of c++ code, just to get like the boilerplate set up. As a Python developer that strikes me as a lot. And how do you feel j? Does that seem like a lot?

00:08:18 Yeah, that's a hard pass.

00:08:20 I'll do my part. Yeah, exactly.

00:08:22 Well, you kind of have like, 1000 lines of code just for a print statement. So Exactly, yeah. Like, that's all the

00:08:28 better files and all. So then there's the compute Python package, which is built on top of the Vulcan SDK using c++ bindings. And that thing is nice and simple. And it's GPU framework, a general purpose graphics processing unit framework, I guess, is the acronym police there. And so if you're interested in building stuff for GPUs, and you don't want to be tied to CUDA cores, then check out this compute Python package. Sounds pretty cool.

00:08:58 Yeah, except for the logo looks like it was like, designed in 1983, or something.

00:09:05 You know, what, maybe I hold on, hold on hold. I think there's a little animation like the Cylon type animation here for the animated GIF with the Python. It has, like ray tracing reflections of the logos. Oh, I kind of dig it, man.

00:09:22 Well, okay. Yeah. Video j split the vote here, come

00:09:25 on, what's it gonna be?

00:09:25 They're probably using all of their GPU power to do something in the background, which is why they couldn't come up with a good logo.

00:09:33 It sounds like a useful framework that people can talk about. And the article talks about, walks you through some examples of using and stuff. I'm not going to go on the details there. But yeah, pretty neat.

00:09:43 I like this is mobile enabled to so you can you can take some of your work on the go.

00:09:48 Yeah, quite cool. I did on your small devices. quite neat. Yeah. Speaking of small devices, day,

00:09:55 oh, you stole my segway. I was gonna say we could use some Vulcan technology to open up a portal. Good, what kind of Portal a PI portal at that? So my pick it we're getting closer to the holiday season, which I can't believe I'm the one that's saying that normally I'm the one that gets angry when people talk about Christmas before Thanksgiving. But yeah, I, I received a little gift from Santa pi. And from there, I thought this would be a great gift for the tinkering. pythonista. It is a PI portal, which I'm actually glad we're live streaming this because I can kind of show it off. Yeah. Nice.

00:10:33 Yeah, do what I think of like circuit Python. And these devices, like it's usually just little chips. And maybe you've got an LED, you can make blink. But that's like a screen. This is like,

00:10:41 all of the little things that we think about when we think of circuit pi on one device. So it has a touchscreen, so not just a regular screen. It's a touchscreen. It has the actual IO that's running right now as a light sensor. So there's a little sensor on the side that if I cover it up, you probably can't see it, but the numbers will actually start changing. There we go. Oh, yeah. And, and of course, since it's running circuit, pi, it is like the easiest thing in the world to to work with. Because at its core foundation, it's just Python. And it's a limited scope of Python. So you kind of have to figure out, you know, what you're importing what you're exporting, but I was able to display my light sensor output in 20 lines of code. And five of those were import statements. So about 15 lines. Awesome. And yeah, I've seen some pretty cool projects with it. So

00:11:37 what's the graphics programming language look like? Is it like draw text? Is it draw pixel?

00:11:44 No, actually, it's object, it's really interesting because of like, they have like actual PI portal module that you can import. And from there, you actually load the screen and you can display full images on. So what you would do is you'll set your background, almost like how the old Atari systems you would come like with these paper backgrounds, and then you would just overlay your actual game data over it, you kind of do that with this like a 2d layered sprite

00:12:10 type thing almost

00:12:12 exactly. You load up like a small bitmap onto the screen. And then you just tell your text where you want it to be placed. And I've seen people do like weather sensors, I actually did a thing with like Twitter lists, so I could check and see like, which Twitter lists that I follow for worker, like having to have the most traffic, you can also throw some audio on there has built in speaker so we played some practical jokes on on relatives by having this having it randomly, every few seconds, just shout names. And they didn't know where it was coming from. So that's always fun. That looks really cool.

00:12:49 Do you know what a cost?

00:12:49 I want to say it's 50 bucks.

00:12:51 Yeah, so not too expensive of a thing. That's a nice one, I like it, I'm still looking for that good use case where I can make some use out of some of these little devices. I think as somebody who does a lot of recording, I really want something I can put on my door. That is have like a sign like recording, please don't open up and yell and ask if I'm recording.

00:13:12 That was the game plan. But I need to get a case for it. And this is actually why Wi Fi enabled. So if you are pulling data in, you can tap into the add a fruit API, and they give you a little dashboard. You can store data there to retrieve later you can pull up data from it, it has its own request library. So you can actually pull stuff down from the web. And that was actually my game plan two was to say, all right, have some little server on my Mac, that whenever I open up, you know zoom or Skype or something like that, it changes the status to now recording and then like, because this is wireless, it would just pick up that signal and change on the door.

00:13:53 Yeah, maybe some serverless function thing where you talk to a database that literally has one entry, recording, not just push it up there, and it's all good to go. Awesome. I'm pretty sure this is gonna exist for at least one of us someday, right? Like, it seems like such a nice thing to have. Yeah, we should do even all this COVID work from home stuff like you've seen those videos of like kids being like crawling in and mom's dragging the kid back out like, okay, so maybe it doesn't work for a two year old. But still, it would be nice. So Brian, I'm not the only one with machine learning here. What do you got?

00:14:22 Well, we've got Yeah, so I guess this is a machine learning stuff. We've got an introduction to linear, an article called introduction to linear algebra for Applied machine learning with Python. Now, I do want to do some machine learning in the future. And definitely, and that's the target for this article, but but you still gotta learn about it. That was bad. was very bad. Actually, I use, we use linear linear algebra is used for communication systems as well. And so I kind of would like to brush up on my linear algebra. I didn't. It was a long time ago when I took it in college. So This article is from Pablo Seras. And it's a big article, he says it's intended as a reference and not a comprehensive review. However, it's a really big reference. This is

00:15:11 a book, it has an epilogue.

00:15:13 Yeah, it is a book. But there's also links, he includes links to both freed and free and paid resources that where he suggests learning linear algebra, including some video classes that are free, which would be neat. But anyway, I think the level that he's got this is really just right for me. And he talks about sets and ordered pairs and relations and functions, then gets into vectors and matrices, and in mappings and matrix decomposition. So it gets pretty deep into the linear algebra. And in some of the examples, he's got diagrams and stuff, which help help me learn the visuals. And he's using NumPy, pandas and Altair for some of the examples. And I think that's pretty cool to show, not only kind of how you do this, how you use linear algebra, are really what it is, and then how to apply those principles with NumPy. And show the examples with Python. It's really kinda nice. So anyway, top is a really useful thing for me. That's

00:16:16 cool. Linear Algebra. It's one of these weird things that like appears in places that you don't expect. It was definitely one of my favorite parts of my math studies. It's the like, advanced linear algebra stuff. But like in 3d computer graphics, the way you rotate, like the viewport and stuff is you just multiply everything by like a rotation matrix. Or if you move something, you multiply it by a matrix, or you make it bigger, smaller, like there's just all these crazy applications of linear algebra. So yeah, it seems pretty neat.

00:16:44 Yeah, a lot of that comes up a lot in, like you said, with, with graphics also, with changing really anything where you've got like massively parallel systems can be described as linear algebra problems. Yeah,

00:16:57 you're nice. Next up, I want to talk about a new notebook framework. We seem to be catering to the data science crowd or scientific computing crowd this this time around. Yeah, but not always. So I recently did a show with Philip gwo. And Sam, and we talked about, I think it was 60 different notebook frameworks. It was Sam Lau and Philip Boyle. Back on episode 268. So you think Jupiter knows there's something else? Oh, there's that Google collab thing? 60.

00:17:29 Well, 60 different wine things, huh?

00:17:32 Yeah. And 61. Now, because there's another one called Deep note. Okay. Jay, have you heard of deep note,

00:17:37 I have actually, I'm kind of upset because this was going to be one of my picks. But I hadn't noticed it yet. I was looking at it for a lightning talk that I gave last week. And I was like, Oh, this is so cool. Too bad. I don't have anyone to collaborate with on this project. Otherwise, I would have tried it. So you beat me to it. I snipe. Yeah,

00:17:59 I got it out of there. Yeah. So deep note is an interesting one. It's Jupiter compatible, like many of the other ones that I sort of indirectly referenced there. But not exactly Jupiter is not like it just runs in Jupiter or Jupiter lab or something. So it, I'm pretty sure like that means import export from Jupiter. And then it runs in the cloud, which is kind of cool. A lot of times it's hosted things, you have to maybe pay for it depending on use it, it's free for individuals. But if you're on a team, when you're in a company, it's going to cost some money. And like Jay was hinting at the main feature of it is real time collaboration, not like just the Jupiter stuff. But you know, let's log in and work on this together and start typing and start reviewing. It has some cool features, like it has code review within the notebook coming. It has built in version control come in, obviously, the real time collaboration that I talked about. And it even has dashboards, kind of like streamlet. I mean, too. And so you can like turn a notebook into an interactive dashboard website.

00:18:57 I'm really excited for the code review stuff. I think that that's something that as Python itself is becoming more and more and more a tool for people outside of the traditional developer space. We still need to have good review tools, and even just a matter of having the ability to do collaboration and say, Hey, can you take a look at this code, and then you could actually see it running instead of just imagining what it's going to do. I think adding version tracking, adding code review. That's just the next step to really teach some of the fundamentals of developer work to skill sets that aren't traditionally designed to work that way.

00:19:38 Yeah. And so much of the Jupiter computation data exploration comes from an individual working on the thing like Jupiter notebooks are not particularly friendly to version control, like GitHub, like every time you make a change, or just the output changes. It clashes in GitHub and things like there's like a merge conflict and all those sorts of things. Do it can be a challenge. So I think you're right, like, moving to a more collaborative, like sort of Google Doc style of world makes a lot of sense. Not for everyone, but for many people.

00:20:07 Yeah. I'm curious if something like this might be useful for, like, say, instructors sort of thing. So yes, you tutor somebody by two people hopping on a on one of these collaborations and working through them. So yeah,

00:20:21 let's cool. J with his last one you got here, you and I've talked a bit about this offline, we have,

00:20:26 this is a tool that I found working on my own blog, it's called image kit. And I'm sure everyone here, you know, listening might or has a good idea of what a CDN is. And the too long didn't read part of it is they also make CDN specifically for images. So you can actually store your images on something like s3 storage, point this CDN to it. And instead of calling that s3, storage, you would just call your CDN URL. And I mean, this is great, because you can do things like compression, you can do responsive types in different sizes. But the thing about image kit that I really liked was that it also does a little bit of machine learning Enos like image magic, behind the scenes. So of course, you can do your own scaling of these images. But you can also do smart cropping. So if you take a picture of your face, and you say, I want the focal point of this image to be my face, you can crop it around your face, and not just around the center of the image, which I think is a really good idea.

00:21:30 Oh, that's cool. That's great. Like, if you had a site where you were accepting, like user profile images, or people were posting stuff you could save, emphasize this, and they don't have to know, how do I crop an image? And why won't it accept a BMP?

00:21:42 Yeah, it's just here, just load this image up to this file storage, and then it's done. It can also do Gaussian blurs, it can do a bunch of the other, you know, little tools, you can overlay text on it, which is like, what I tend to do the most is where I'll take my podcast episodes, add that to the end of the URL for the image. And it creates a smart overlay on top of it grayed out, you know, with the grayed out background and everything, so that I don't have to go into like Photoshop, or, you know, one of those tools, I can just say, here's the URL, here's the text that I want. And of course, because this is Python bytes, it has a Python API, it actually has a ton of API. So like, they have, like, first party API's for most of the primary languages. But if you don't have time to play with the API, you don't have a way to access the API before you render your page. It also has a URL schema. So you can also give all of those commands directly into the URL itself. And it's pretty cheap. I mean, right now, I'm not paying for it at all, just using their free tier. But if you want things like a custom domain name, we can say images dot Python bytes, or something else. That's when you start having to look at it. But I think even then it's not. For an image CDN. It's not too bad.

00:22:58 Yeah, I was cool. And you could put like resizing in there, just like I want the size to be such and such. That's important for like Google PageSpeed, especially on mobile devices. If you want to put like a 2000, whatever, do thousand by whatever picture. You don't want to just show that directly, right. So you can just make it part of the URL even do like responsive design, like use different URLs for different screen media queries and stuff.

00:23:20 It also supports fuzzy or lazy loading, which is really cool to where you can get like a blurred image until it finishes rendering the entire site. And then once it's done the entire site, it'll go back, and then load the high def image. Oh, nice.

00:23:34 Yeah, this is cool. I like it. And you mentioned your podcasts like tell people real quick, your podcast?

00:23:39 Oh, sure. Yeah. So I do a weekly show called The Pit show. Pit is short for productivity in tech. It's been around for a few years. I think, once upon a time, on some RSS feed far, far away. I had Michael Kennedy on on the show. That was fine. I think I'm still trying to get that Brian fell on there as well. But I'm sure we'll make that happen. At some point.

00:24:00 I thought we already did that.

00:24:01 We haven't done that. Never did, but I blamed my schedule. So it's okay. I guess as a developer advocate, now, I get a lot of questions about, you know, hey, what's your journey in tech? How did you do this? Where did you get these things? What's it like, you know, not just for you, but for your family and other things like that. So it's a combination of two things. One, it's my walk through this journey out loud, showing people what I'm going through some of the things that I'm doing some of the things that I'm playing with practicing on, but also interviewing folks from around the internet, from all sorts of disciplines and asking the questions because I can because I have them on my my show for 30 minutes at a time.

00:24:43 That's awesome. Brian, you got to get on there. We got to hear story. So maybe that's, that was the last item so maybe we should just roll into the extras. Jay, you want to keep going you? You said you were a Developer Advocate now. Congratulations. That's an exciting new role you just got right

00:24:58 yeah. Then at that four months now really enjoying it. And of course, because I'm doing this in the middle of the day, I'm gonna take this opportunity to promote to the things that I've been doing a lot, which are our contributor program. I work for elastic, the company behind Elasticsearch, we also are responsible for LogStash and Kibana. I think that was how I got I snuck onto this shows because I messaged Mike, after he said that Elasticsearch wasn't a real database. So, shots fired. But then from there, yeah, if you're doing anything with Elasticsearch, Kibana, LogStash beats, even some of our Python specific clients, we have a contributor program, if you do a blog post video tutorial, let us know, we have a whole platform, there's a link here in the show notes. And if you do enough of it, we actually give you credits to elastic cloud, so you can post some of your projects for free. And then also, we have our YouTube channel, the elastic community YouTube channel where you can see meetup talks, lightning talks, I just the lightning talk I talked about earlier in the show is on there as well. You've got a lot of great folks that are teaching and sharing that information. Here's a single point where you can go and you can watch hours and hours of good information and good content on it. Awesome.

00:26:14 That's really cool. And people are in Elastic Search, they should definitely check that out. Yeah, definitely.

00:26:18 So I think I would just bring up, I've been plugging away at testing code that testing code comm for that's a podcast I do. But I think we're gonna, I'm gonna try to change the direction a little bit. So since um, I really like the short format. As always do it again, but you got to say something so that you get on the video thing. If you like,

00:26:43 testing code, you should totally check out this book. It's called Python testing with PI test. It's by this Brian arkin.

00:26:50 I thought that was how to build rockets with Python.

00:26:53 At first, I was like, man, he needs to talk to those pi torch characters, you know, maybe they can help him, you know, blast off or something. But no, I really, I genuinely say this is probably the most open book that I have, like within reach of me, because I'm always screwing up testing. and nice. Luckily, I don't have to message Brian, every five minutes on how do I do this? I just use his words.

00:27:16 I don't need any extra is more than that. So Thanks, Jay. You Boy, you

00:27:19 said your change your direction, what's your direction,

00:27:21 I kind of want to hear what people would like to do. I was thinking about possibly doing shorter episodes are more focused, like maybe 10 minute episodes about individual topics, but I kind of like to hear from other people about what they'd like to hear. So yeah, just,

00:27:35 I love a podcast only about mocking, cuz that's just the one thing that no one understands. Because nobody should do it.

00:27:44 Hey, how am I gonna fix my dependency inversion, and version control stuff in my Java app without mocking come on? Well,

00:27:52 yeah, Java, you might need it.

00:27:56 Alright, I got a few things. One, my apple, M, one chip, can Apple Mac Mini wait continues. But eventually I will give you all, like mid December. Eventually, I'll give you all of like the state of Python on Apple in one chips. But until I know that I can't share it. So over a talk by on training, we are running, we're participating in the Python Software Foundation fundraiser to close out the year. So because of time travel, that is not announced they're probably not even known yet. But at the time of the release of this, it should be out it starts December 1. So if you visit Python by sarafem, slash PSF 2020. Right, now, it's going to go to a page that says nothing yet. But I'm going to change that redirect to the end on the right place when it goes live. So there's going to be some discounts on some of our courses, half of all the payments will go like half of the revenue, not profits, half the revenue will go to spun the PSF. So I teamed up with the PSF team and a couple other folks like real Python and invader over there and a few others to try to, you know, give some money to the PSF keep them going strong. And last but not least trying something new as podcasters you guys can tell me what you think of this idea. I wanted to give something back to the people that supported the training course the most and the podcast the most. So I launched this thing called talk Python to me pro edition, which basically means it just has no ads. And it has all the history of like back five years worth of shows and the podcast player. So anyway, people can check that out as well at talk python.fm slash Pro. And yeah, anyway, that's kind of fun to put together. And those are all my items, I think, yeah, let's do a joke, man. All right. You asked the question. I'll do the answer.

00:29:45 Okay, why can't SQL and no SQL developers date one another?

00:29:49 I don't know. It's rough. I guess because they don't agree on relationships. so bad. Jay as a professional at a database company. How do you feel about This,

00:30:00 um

00:30:03 I would have said because date time formatting is hard, but I can definitely vouch for this. But even though they can't date, they can still get along. They can still get along, they still have ETL. Come on, to closing this out. Like, I'll post a video of the live stream here. Once it gets recorded and saved, though, maybe we'll do some people can let us know if they think that's a cool idea. If people are wondering why I'm at a weird angle in the dark, it's because of the power of my neighborhood went out. I've been doing this show from my phone. So anyway, nice. If we're always be like that. Good.
