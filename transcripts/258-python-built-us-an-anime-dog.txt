0:00 Michael Kennedy  00:00

0:00 Hello, and welcome to python bytes where we deliver Python news and headlines directly to your earbuds. This is Episode 258, recorded November 10 2021. I'm Michael Kennedy.

0:00 Brian Okken  00:10

0:00 And I'm Brian knockin.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  00:11

0:00 And I'm Karen Dalton. Yay.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  00:13

0:00 Yay. Welcome, Karen. So good to have you here.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  00:16

0:00 It is quite a delight and an honor. I've been a longtime fan, as they say on the radio, longtime listener, first time caller of both of your podcasts and books and, and Slack channels and training. And so I'm really excited to be here.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  00:33

0:00 Oh, thanks for being part of the community and all those ways. And you and I got to meet down at pi Bay in San Francisco. That was a lot of fun.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  00:40

0:00 Yeah, I, Brian, I don't know if Brian knows, I arrived at pi Bay. And I was going to be one of the MCS and I saw Michael Kennedy who I cherry picked to introduce I you know, I was one of the organizers and emcee for the event and approached him and overwhelmed and not like your super fan. And he was like, um, so, but he was very gracious about about being fangirled. Just at the registration table.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  01:10

0:00 Yeah, no, you were a great helped me out with a talk. Thank you so much. And hey, it's Anthony shot in the live stream. He says, I Karen, great to have you on the show. Nice. Hey, Anthony. Anthony. And I just did a show on pigeon pie GPIO and the JIT compiler that he just released version one. Oh, that talk Python episode will be out today. Tomorrow. Fingers crossed very, very soon. So stay tuned for more on that. But let's start with whatever you brought us, Brian. Well, number one, well, I

0:00 Brian Okken  01:38

0:00 figure we really need to talk about Wilma Cogan because you know get has

0:00 Michael Kennedy  01:43

0:00 it been a show since?

0:00 Brian Okken  01:46

0:00 So just get that out of the way. So on Twitter will ask the general question to everybody something like if I've got an open source project, and somebody files an issue with it, but I have a question about it. And I asked them a question. And they don't ever respond for a really long time. So is there a way to just automatically clean those up or clean them up easily? Because we could just assume that the person has figured out or solve the problem where it's not a problem anymore, or they don't care. So one of the responses, which I liked, which I thought was pretty cool was I bought a GitHub bot. And it's actually from GitHub, it's a bot called stale. So it's a bot that closes stale issues and prs. And the, the gist of it like on the tin it says it warns and then closes issues and PRs that have had no activity for a specified amount of time. That sounds perfect configuration must be on the default branch. And the default values will be it will add a stale label to issues or PRs that are six with after 60 days of inactivity, and close stale issues or in PRs after seven days of inactivity. And if an update or comment occurs during that timeframe, it restarts the clock. But all of those are not for me, since I'm an open source maintainer, but I don't like sometimes they don't pay attention to him for a couple months. I would definitely want to bump that up to make sure that it's at least within my timeframe so that you know my own if my own inactivity problems might not be the case. So I totally

0:00 Michael Kennedy  03:27

0:00 hear that I would love to see one minor change one more bullet point on the things that does add a steel label after 60 days, close it after seven days of inactivity. A comment will bring it back. But I would love to see this bot put a comment on there saying if we don't deal with this, it's going away that way the people who submitted the PR will get an email, that maintainer will get an email. And so like you're notified the seven day clock has begun, you know, Karen, you're shaking your head.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  03:57

0:00 Yeah, I mean, I've certainly seen it on open source repos. And it's it's nice to have that there. But sometimes it's an issue that's important to you and you don't want it to necessarily go away like and I wish there was a way to like say this is actually really important to me please don't close and even if you get pay attention to Yeah,

0:00 Brian Okken  04:22

0:00 for instance, I'm in one of the settings is bunch of settings. One of the settings is a stale issue message or comment on steel issue. So it lets you go get it does talk about it. Alright, that one. And I think there's exempt tissue labels, labels, is exempted out so you can mark something as a you know, keep this around or something. Oh, so

0:00 Unknown Speaker  04:44

0:00 see I can I don't have that window ups. I didn't scroll. Perfect. Yeah. So

0:00 Michael Kennedy  04:48

0:00 it looks like it's well thought out then. I love it now. Yeah.

0:00 Brian Okken  04:52

0:00 And it's been around for a while and it's got like, I guess only for 498 stars, but it'll be more than that after we do this show.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  05:00

0:00 That's right. Exactly. At least 500.

0:00 Brian Okken  05:03

0:00 Yeah, 499.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  05:07

0:00 This is a great find. I really like it. So, yeah, go on brain.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  05:11

0:00 Yeah, I think I'm really impressed with GitHub that they've added so many features, I use it more than I have an app. So Git lab May has may have as many, you know, in all fairness, but GitHub has added lots of cool features and ongoing development to make things easier. As you know, many things have evolved lots of more features added, but things like this that make it easier to maintain things.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  05:36

0:00 I'm really happy with the way the direction of GitHub these days, so seems like it's going really well. Yeah, yeah, definitely happy there.

0:00 Brian Okken  05:43

0:00 I use both. I like them both. But GitHub definitely is has a focus on the or at least I it feels like it's listening to open source maintainers and their needs. Yeah,

0:00 Michael Kennedy  05:53

0:00 for sure. For sure. Alright, so I want to show you another one that I think also may involve OMA Kook, and I got to do a quick check here is called Judd, do you maybe if you're you're German, it's you? I don't know. But we could look at the power project Tommasi of riches. And here it is. Okay, so yeah, it definitely involves original McGugan. And what it is, is, it's a render, not a interactive environment, but a renderer for Jupyter Notebooks. And we've had that, you know, in B viewer, and things like that, like on the web, but this one is in your terminal. So here's the scenario, like you're in the terminal, remote, maybe SSH into a remote machine, and you're like, oh, there's this notebook file. But what the heck is this? What is it, I'm like, I don't have a browser or whatever. And so the way that it works, let me pull this little animation for everyone and have it go is if you're somewhere you just say mega doot, doot, give it a URL. And you can literally give it something off of the internet. And you can even give it like tail command. So I want to see the last 10 cells instead of lines, and it uses rich to colorize. And style, what the notebook has, including the data cells, as well as the actual output, a computation, you know, the notebooks will store their output from last time they were run, unless you clear them, it'll show that as well. What do you think,

0:00 Unknown Speaker  07:14

0:00 I love that. I mean, there's, there's, sometimes you get a file, and you just want to check some introspect some portion of it. And you can't just do more per cat on a to Jupyter Notebook. Yeah, you get to know and wrong, and I don't, sometimes in the space that you're in, you don't, you just want to quickly be able to check what it is and move on. And so I love that. And I love rich, it that's that it's in the color, the colorized terminal, it's really helpful.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  07:44

0:00 Honestly, it might have better syntax highlighting the notebooks themselves. Probably what we could say, no, no,

0:00 Brian Okken  07:52

0:00 just I love. I really like the focus and have tools making things usable on on command line, because I'm a command line lover. And I mean, I've got nothing against doing notebooks in on the in a web browser. But things like this make it possible to do things like put them in a pipeline and automate them more easily. And like this, it's not really automating using the notebook, but it might be, you might make sure that like something is, you know, a regression thing. You want to make sure that things are visible. So you can use this to grab grab one off your GitHub repo or something that makes sure nothing weird happened. Yes, for

0:00 Michael Kennedy  08:33

0:00 sure. Yeah, looks good. And to bring it back around full circle, will McGugan an audience says neat. That's a new one for me. Hey, well, yeah, it's always fun to show you projects using your library, because there's a bunch of cool ones out there. Awesome. All right, well, I'm not sure what else to say about this one other than it was sent into a spy kid pic. So thank you for that. That was awesome. Keep them coming, send a bunch of things along. Like I said, you can display the different cells like the first five, Last five, you know, whatever you want to pass over, you can also do things like show it to me just in plain text. If you for some reason want to copy it, you don't want the formatting. Pretty straightforward to use, but also really nice. Alright, Karen, you're up next.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  09:11

0:00 Adding on to the the Jupiter thread. One of the interesting things that's coming out is Jupiter light. It's a is being developed by core Jupiter developers, but it's still unofficial. And one of the nice things it's is static. And if you share it with somebody, they can just go to a web page, and you can just you can cache it. So you don't have to have a Jupyter Notebook server running that it's a static page. Obviously, there's JavaScript and other elements involved. And so if you just click on one of those things, try with Jupiter lab, it takes you to a browser that window says as you can see the static page, it's going to take a second to come up because it's got some JavaScript, and if you click on that pilight And then just do like can import this to see a standard kind of notebook. Yeah, it has a little it has a notebook tour if you do an import this, which is its standard kind of tests to do the Python mantras it, you know, it runs simply and that's all just running in a browser. So obviously, it's, if you want to share things with some somebody, it's, it's an easy way for for them to see it, you would just send them that file, and they can open it up and do some additional things, it's probably you won't want to run your cord data pipelines in a static web browser window. But it does allow you to do a variety of things in there, some sample notebooks included with it, let you do some some things. So you can run through either step by step that you can actually add text into, as you saw, into the window. So it's, it's a nice feature add to be able to run a notebook in a browser window and show some examples of your code in a static way. I know that, you know, people have sent me joke Jupyter notebooks or shared them, or sometimes you could see them on GitHub, even tools now that you can do git diffs, there's a service that allows you to do diffs of Jupyter notebooks that you can do that for your pull request reviews. But sometimes it's nice to be able to see like, I'd like to change this a little bit without like, starting up a server yourself. So

0:00 Michael Kennedy  11:24

0:00 yeah, yeah, we've been able to host these, we've been able to set up notebooks servers and host them. But there's issues with letting people run code, maybe don't want to let them run it. It's only read only and so but this is cool, because it will let you run it in the browser, right, which is using WebAssembly.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  11:40

0:00 Yeah, exactly. And they, you can have the Jupiter lab look or kind of retro look, which is just very minimalist without that kind of UI. So it's, it's really nice. I've never tried retro retro lab. Yeah, it's just more of a basic like bio list. It doesn't have that. It doesn't have that nice kind of look and feel of the newer version of Jupiter lab.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  12:05

0:00 But it works. Yeah, fantastic. Just run all the cells. And it runs I guess, in web assembly. Super cool. Oh, yeah, that's, that's a good one, right? anything

0:00 Unknown Speaker  12:14

0:00 as simple pip install, and then you you run another command is to it to generate all the JavaScript and things it needs. And then once that index file is made, that directory is made, then it's really easy. You just open up that index dot HTML on your, on your, you can run it on localhost, you can pipe on start at http server with a, you know, easily with python three. So that will serve that page as well.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  12:42

0:00 And even deploy it to GitHub Pages or something like Netlify, or some other static Host. Yeah, pretty sweet.

0:00 Brian Okken  12:48

0:00 I definitely think I agree that you don't want to do big heavy workloads on this, but especially for graphing and interactive stuff. And just like tweaking the data a little bit, I think this is amazing to be able to, especially for reports and things. There's a lot of other places where this abusable Yep.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  13:07

0:00 And you have no security issues, or worried about people running code or messing with it. Because whatever they do, they're doing this themselves. Exactly.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  13:15

0:00 Right. There's no little Bobby Tables, issues that you have to worry about with a static web browser on your site. Yeah,

0:00 Michael Kennedy  13:22

0:00 you definitely want to lower your surface area there. I Brian, a bit of an intermission. Yeah,

0:00 Brian Okken  13:28

0:00 um, let's talk about our sponsor today. So today's sponsors shortcut, which is formerly clubhouse. And thank you for sponsoring the episode. There are a lot of project management tools out there. And I've used I've used a ton of them. But most servers suffer from a few common problems. They're either too complex, and it's hard to get started. And there's all tons of options all the time, make you confused, or they're too simple. And you really you can get started on one project, but you can't use it for multiple projects and stuff. Or they seem to be like geared towards managers, but difficult for engineers or geared towards engineers and difficult for managers. I think shortcut is different. So shortcut is built for software teams and based on making workflows easy, which I like. So let's say you have a big scale objectives, goals and roadmaps. Topics can those and items in those big goals and roadmaps can easily be tied to teams and individual work sprints and progress on those can be easily, easily flow back into reports at the top level. It's keyboard friendly, so that you can hook up short codes and stuff. So you don't the UI is intuitive, and it's pretty easy to use. But the things you do every day, you can tie those to keyboard shortcuts and make them even faster, and it has tight VCs integration. So you can update your test progress progress by just adding a comment or a little key code into your commit or PR and it flows back upstream. This is really cool. iteration planning is also a breeze. You can see your activity team activity when you need it. But you can see your own work really easily when you need that too. And burndown charts and cycle time and lead time charts are just built in for you. It's really, really great to see all that. So finally a project management tool for both engineers and managers. Give it a try it shortcut comm slash Python bytes.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  15:22

0:00 Awesome. Thanks for okay. Hey, Brian, before we move on to your next item that Jupiter light was sent in by Marcel Millicent. So thank you, Marcel, for sending that over. Yeah, nice. Yeah. We always appreciate when our listeners help us do our research, because they have all these ideas that we don't know about.

0:00 Brian Okken  15:39

0:00 Yeah,

0:00 Unknown Speaker  15:40

0:00 so yeah, thanks for picking that up.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  15:43

0:00 Yeah, of course. Well,

0:00 Brian Okken  15:44

0:00 Ach, ACH. Now, supplies are limited. I don't actually know Wait, wait more. Yeah, I want to talk about grep a little bit. I use grep all the time for, for finding stuff within my codes command line tool for finding finding stuff in files. And we're not going to cover it in the show. But I threw it in the show notes. If you're not if you don't use grep or tools like grep I threw in a couple of examples in the show notes to get you started really easily. It's, uh, I think I think it's useful to find stuff. One question I did have is like, I've got a command sequence in the show notes that I'd like to have people look take a look at, I don't have the screenshot for it. But if I want to find like, say foo in in recursively, and all the all the folders and directories, I can do that easily. And I want to try to eliminate a directory like don't look in my virtual environment folder. I've kind of weird thing about using just grep and then piping it to another grep. I don't know how to do it easier. So please help me out. But anyway, this article I'm, I'd like to point to is called feature comparison of ACC, Silver Surfer get grip, a new grip and rip grip. And this is actually really cool. So it's it's put out by the ACC people themselves. Beyond grep.com Ack is a kind of a GREP alternative that's written in Perl. But this comparison chart says we need more comparison charts like this. And in it, how it compares all these different alternatives to grep. Silver Surfer silver searcher sorry, is ag ag for silver, it's kind of clever. But the this chart

0:00 Unknown Speaker  17:30

0:00 from the chemical is symbol table. Yeah, and

0:00 Brian Okken  17:33

0:00 I'm also kind of a play on Silver Surfer the, the superhero as well. So the the chart shows like, kind of a whole bunch of stuff about all these tools, like what language they're written in, most of them are in C, but ACC is in Perl and RG or rip grep is in rust. So that kind of intrigues me, I've been enjoying some rust tools lately. But it goes through a whole bunch of features. So I didn't really know that these were all that different. So if you're going to try something new, it's kind of nice to see if the thing that you really need qualifies, and it's got some high level features, but then also dives into like specifics, like if you have specific pattern matching needs or output needs, but kind of a cool tool to decide which grep alternative to use.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  18:19

0:00 It's called I'd never heard of get grabbed, that'll let you grep but against a Git repo. I don't know, it says up at the top that it lets you search a git repository by default, like search wire right at the bottom of your screen there. Oh, yeah. So that was pretty interesting. Repo by default. Oh, nine, search your get history. That sounds youthful? Yeah,

0:00 Brian Okken  18:39

0:00 let's try that out to school. Bakley

0:00 Michael Kennedy  18:42

0:00 I'm gonna make me learn grep but actually,

0:00 Brian Okken  18:44

0:00 so one of the things I do appreciate is if people that right tool like little tools that are alternatives to something else, often they do look at the landscape to find out what else is out there and try things out. So actually, one of the one of the reasons I'm highlighting is that this is I agree with the with the author that says we need more of these take that research you've done and actually publish it. Because some of the sometimes one of these tool authors is the is one of the best people to compare all the different alternatives. So

0:00 Michael Kennedy  19:14

0:00 yeah, at the school. Nice one. I don't use grep nearly as much as I should or hardly at all, but it seems very useful in this get like I said this get one might make me learn grep guaranteed do anything with GREP Oh, it's all good. We're happy to have your puppy on the show as well.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  19:28

0:00 Yeah. featuring five moments old golden retriever. It's very vocal. Yeah, I love silver shirtr I think it's really super fast. If you're, that's, that's my favorite of these. One time ago, I started programming in my backgrounds in molecular biology. I started in academic publishing are finding academic journals online. And so parole is, you know, close to my heart, but I'm surprised that you know, like, these parole tools that are still around Round, they still work perfectly fine. I learned a lot of Perl compatible, regular expression use in that PCRs. In, I remember asking some years ago, you know, in another language, they had PCRE regular expression, they're like what's PCRE? You know, it's broke compatible, regular expression. So, but AG is great. I think in my world, a lot of people are submitting data. And sometimes you're looking for bits and pieces and things. And so these kinds of tools are really helpful. I use grep, mostly because that's, you know, it's easy to pipe it to something else. But AG is great, great because it polarizes your results without passing $1 flag, which is usually more convenient. It's a little bit different syntax. So. So, but I haven't used some of these other ones. So this is a goal to know about.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  20:50

0:00 Yeah, it's always good to learn about more,

0:00 Brian Okken  20:52

0:00 they'll try all of them just for the heck

0:00 Michael Kennedy  20:54

0:00 Nice. Yeah. All right, I want to talk about airtable real quick. So air table is like Excel. But it kind of has a database back end. It's also got like a Trello aspect to it. So I don't know, if people are using air table for things. It also has kind of a Gantt chart, or project management thing, don't exactly when to talk about air table. But I want to set the stage I want to talk about pi air table. So I just had GUI the maintainer of this on the on talk Python, to talk about Python and architecture and what they were doing where he was working with. A lot of things were backed by air table. So pyure table is this, this API to talk to it through Python, which is pretty interesting already. But then if you look a little bit more on the docks, it's gone. Where's the right spot to go? Look, there is under the API. Somewhere in here, there's an ORM aspect as well. So you can even use air table like an ORM, where you create classes that map to the stuff you're doing over there and do SELECT statements against it and delete them and whatnot. So if people are doing stuff with air table, here's a pretty awesome way to automate it.

0:00 Brian Okken  22:06

0:00 I think. I think it's great. Is it done by the same people or?

0:00 Michael Kennedy  22:09

0:00 No, no, it's done by a guy named GUI last name. I'm gonna look sorry, GUI.

0:00 Brian Okken  22:17

0:00 I just think it's a it's pretty cool to have. Oh, nice name.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  22:21

0:00 Yeah. Taller, taller. Taller Rico. Yeah, we Talarico. And he's also in San Francisco's. He's one of your extended neighbors. Karen.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  22:31

0:00 Yeah. I and the Bay Area is big.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  22:36

0:00 Yeah, he was also a PI Bay. Yeah.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  22:38

0:00 Well, there is a lot of people had mass. So even people that are in my community, I'm a co organizer for a Bay Area Python interest group where the longest running Python groups, obviously I didn't, I didn't start it. But I recently started helping out and even people that I'm in meetings with every month, and for a number of years, they have to say like, oh, Karen, and even with badges on. So I, yeah, I, I you tried to like spy people? Or, you know, based on their silhouette, if that's the right person. So

0:00 Michael Kennedy  23:15

0:00 yeah, it was a lot of people had sunglasses or hat. Yeah, it was it was tricky. But yeah, so he was there. So yeah, he maintains us, but it's sort of endorsed by the air table folks, like listed as one of the independent things that they might recommend for people doing Python. So

0:00 Unknown Speaker  23:31

0:00 yeah, I think it's great to have Python API's for a lot of services that, you know, have a Python client to help support them. And it's really helpful that, whether it's written by the company or somebody else, and sometimes it's really helpful, if you're a small team, as the kinds of teams, I'm in a research community, we have small teams to be able to like look at the tests, look at their code to see how to use it. Sometimes the company's documentation is not great on how to use their API. And sometimes these extra Python components help you understand their API a little better, and what you can do with their API, some companies are better than others in documenting their own API's to be able to interact with, but I know that people use air table for a variety of different things and use things like Zapier to connect it to, you know, it's like a Rube Goldberg kind of like stitching together all these kinds of services to do, you know, thing at the end, like make toast.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  24:31

0:00 Yeah, cuz you want to let the business people still just use air table, but you need other things that happen or something like that. Right? Right. So when they intersect, and they insert this, it's going to heat up that thing, which knock over a cup, which will then trigger an API like that kind of thing.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  24:45

0:00 Yeah, yeah. Or send a meeting invite. So

0:00 Brian Okken  24:49

0:00 what exactly one of the things I like is, if like a company that's using one of these tools, having a Python API allows individual hackers like me to be able to just say How do I find just the stuff I need to care about? And I can write my own little application just to pull out the bits that I need to care about. And do it on the command line and probably use a rich if I doing that, and I only see

0:00 Michael Kennedy  25:13

0:00 grep grep airtable for things to do assign.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  25:17

0:00 Yeah, no, yeah, I've actually done that you can search within GitHub itself, or I sometimes I'll clone it and kind of for some keywords, that help might help me figure out what I need to do a little bit faster.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  25:31

0:00 Yeah, yeah, for sure. And, Neil, Heather out there. Just given a quick shout out to Bay piggies, the meetup group out there. Awesome. Nice. Very cool. All right.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  25:40

0:00 We have a we have we're pretty fortunate in the Bay Area that we have several different from all the way from down in Santa Cruz. So for people to know that, you know, the Bay Area is or depending on how you're looking at it, you know, the San Francisco Bay, and there's meetup groups and Python groups all along in we're kind of a mid to South Peninsula. There's all the way up Santa Cruz to up to SF Python, which runs pi Bay, gray slaw, and there's other ones in the North Bay. So we're pretty fortunate to have a lot of really rich, strong community.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  26:16

0:00 Yeah, a lot of great local stuff going on there for sure. which is no surprise in San Francisco. But

0:00 Brian Okken  26:21

0:00 it's also necessary because even though things are close together, you can't get there from here usually

0:00 Michael Kennedy  26:27

0:00 separated by far by time. If not,

0:00 Unknown Speaker  26:29

0:00 yeah, the traffic is starting to pick up again. For sure.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  26:33

0:00 Yeah, same here. Alright, Karen, you want to do our last item here, touch one more time on some notebook things?

0:00 Unknown Speaker  26:39

0:00 Yeah. One of the the ways if you're part of a team, every, everyone probably knows about the black form matter that helps you make opinionated decisions, or it makes opinionated decisions for you about how things should be formatted. So your, your team's a little bit more streamlined. And now, Mirko Garelli, as who is a creator of a package called indie QA for notebook, QA that did things like I sorted and other things has added into black, the black format or itself, and ability to do black formatting on notebooks, which is great, because then it's part of the core package and support will be even richer. Very powerful. So you can just run once you've once you've installed it, it there's a command, they're shown on the screen, pip install black that you can run black on it like notebook, you know, black

0:00 Michael Kennedy  27:40

0:00 would probably say here, like within Jupiter itself, right? Say that, again. There's probably like some kind of little icon or hotkey or something in there automatically, right? I would guess

0:00 Unknown Speaker  27:52

0:00 I don't know, I've run it on the command line. And the instructions, have it run on a command line. I don't know if you can run it on itself. It'd be like, you know, modifying an array that you're iterating over. I don't know if this is actually yourself. Wow.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  28:10

0:00 This is actually going into black not into Jupiter. Right. So yeah, so it's more right. Yeah, black side. Got

0:00 Unknown Speaker  28:15

0:00 it? Yeah, you're running it against a notebook to apply black formatting to a notebook itself.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  28:23

0:00 Yeah. But at this point, how long until somebody puts a button into Jupiter? To do this?

0:00 Unknown Speaker  28:28

0:00 Yeah, I imagine that certainly can happen. I think that you have like in VS code, you already can apply black or other kinds of f8 formatting within something. So I imagine that totally makes sense. You'd be able to apply it. But I guess I think about it in that sense. It's not the notebook itself that's applying that standardization. It's a package runs running against whatever kind of thing that you're using, whether it's pi charm or VS code or some other tool, so I still think it's running against it rather than the notebook itself, changing itself, like spinning around like Wonder Woman becoming super sorted. I sort, you know, packaging for

0:00 Michael Kennedy  29:08

0:00 Absolutely. Now, this is cool. I really like this. I've always thought that the notebooks lacked a little bit of coding assistance, standardization to Yeah, and also black brings that right, but I felt like, you know, if you type a thing.it doesn't pull up any autocomplete, you have to do the research to know well now I have to proactively hit Tab to trigger an autocomplete and, you know, also, formatting is not just a hotkey for format, my code or command palette thing to format my code as easily. Yeah,

0:00 Unknown Speaker  29:39

0:00 I imagine that you were lucky that this the Jupiter community is really rich and people are committed to it and enhancing on it. I know that there's other kinds of notebook systems that are being developed by places like Netflix where they're like, What is the bare bones we can do is that our our data scientists can run something else But the Jupyter Notebook communities really extensively use the community is very active. So I'm glad that things like this are being added to enhance its usability and readability and standardize it in an easier way for everyone.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  30:17

0:00 Yeah, absolutely. Well done marker. O'Brien. I think that brings us to the extras. Extras. You got any extras you want to throw out there?

0:00 Brian Okken  30:27

0:00 No, I just like, I'm not gonna like put a link or anything. But I just wanted to comment some of the times I've been giggling today is because Anthony shows on the show. And we talked about pigeon versus briefly. And every time I hear the about pigeon, I think of the Burton Ernie skit with doing the pigeon. I don't know if anybody else remembers that. But anyway, that's that's my quick extra

0:00 Michael Kennedy  30:52

0:00 add on. Well, I know that Anthony shot likes to run vs. Code pets. Yeah, sure. That's right.

0:00 Brian Okken  30:58

0:00 I think I wonder if there's a pigeon in this. Yes, maybe

0:00 Michael Kennedy  31:00

0:00 maybe could come full circle. And it could be some kind of pigeon in the pet. And the pet is like below the project setting. So that'd be fantastic.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  31:09

0:00 What are the what are these pets that you're talking about?

0:00 Michael Kennedy  31:12

0:00 In? Let me see if I can find it. Let's see if I can see vs. Code pets. Yeah, I don't have a link. I don't do that much VS code. So I don't know all that much. But what it is, is it will literally put like a little animated animal in your editor. And it can be simple like this. This is like a cat that's cruel, crawling along like a git diff section. Or they can be way more complicated. Like here, like see this one. For example. There's like a castle, and there's a cat that lives in the end. Alas, Anthony Shaw says, but there is no pigeon on the pets extension. There's a lot of stuff happening like here. Here we go. There's like a hunting cat in the forest and all kinds of things. So and Chris May, in the live stream says yet there's no pigeon. Yeah. Wow.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  31:58

0:00 Pull Request accepted.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  32:00

0:00 Exactly, exactly. Who's gonna be adding this anyway, this. This is how we should bring it around full circle. Brian,

0:00 Brian Okken  32:07

0:00 well, do you have any extras?

0:00 Michael Kennedy  32:08

0:00 I do, but always have them. So let me ask Karen, if she has anything she wants to add or throw out while we're here?

0:00 Unknown Speaker  32:13

0:00 Yeah, well, it's a general thing. I just helped out at IB, I help out at bay piggies in, I just went off. Just tell people, whatever, wherever your community is, they're always looking for lightning talks. It's good practice. It's as, as both of you know, Michael and Brian, that, you know, coming up with show ideas or, you know, meetup talks, and finding speakers is a challenge. And so, you know, offering something that you want to talk about is good practice. And people in the communities around you are really supportive and welcoming. And a lightning talks, great practice, it gets you feedback. And I know that for somebody who's, who talked it at bay piggies and also for some of the speakers at pi Bay. You know, I've been willing to work with them on their slides and talk to them how to give the talk and everything to it's, it's great practice, both, you know, professionally, and then you have recording of what you talked about. So tribute, you can tribute in code, or you can contribute any ideas and experience in your learning journey. Even if you're just starting out, talking about that journey is really helpful talking about a new package that came out. And and you guys are doing a fantastic job bringing things up to date, but maybe, you know, in these other communities, people can do that. I just want to just open it up. It's not just the experts who are contributing at people at every level in your local meetups can can give a talk and it's good experience. It's good for you. It's good for them. And so I'm just going to encourage everybody to volunteer in your Python community.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  33:53

0:00 Yeah, absolutely. And if you're thinking about doing like submitting a Toxis, a pie con, or another big conference, doing it locally, at your local meetup with people, you know, with just 10 people is a really good way to practice that and get a sense for what it's going to be like if you do get accepted and hone it a little bit.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  34:09

0:00 Yeah, great feedback and great questions, too. So yeah, perfect prep. Great.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  34:13

0:00 Yep. All right. My Apple Watch wants me to stand up. But instead, I'm going to talk about some extras. So first one is, I've been playing around with a new password manager, I use one password, I love one password. I use it on all my things. But I've decided that there are certain things I would like to put on systems. I don't want to set up my super important passwords on or I want to share with people and so on that guy well, what else could I use? So I came across a bit Warden, which is an open source password manager that also has like a cloud back end and mobile apps and all sorts of stuff browser integration, though, instead of just a running a local encrypted file or something. This is a really good option. From what I can tell for sending up it does. It does have a paid plan if you want but if you look at the paid Plan, the paid personal plan, it's like $10 a year or $1, you know, like 80 cents a month or something. So it's, it's totally doable

0:00 Unknown Speaker  35:09

0:00 as for only 80 cents a month, you too could be secure.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  35:13

0:00 Exactly. For the coffee that you spilled on yourself the price of that you could.

0:00 Brian Okken  35:18

0:00 I like this bucket, but actually just a bunch of other stuff. But it's driving me kind of nuts that even like five or $10 a month or $20 a month for some things. Everything is going towards these subscription plans. And it's like, yeah, just storing my password. I don't want to pay $20 a month. So yep.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  35:35

0:00 This also has a self hosted version, I believe, because it's open source, you could run it at your company, if that was not the kind of thing you wanted to do. So anyway, cool. Good recommendation, I think this is a pretty neat option. Again, I'm still using one password for my personal main stuff. But this is like my, I want another one that doesn't hold all that stuff. And it's it's pretty neat. Also, Chris, may, I'll give you a shout out for high RVA for the Virginia Meetup is also looking for speakers. Because Chris, as Karen and as we know, booking people to come for this kind of stuff is never easy.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  36:06

0:00 Lightning Talks, long talks whenever, you know, there's lots to talk about.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  36:10

0:00 Show up. Help us out. Alright, so big word, check it out. seems cool open source bonus as well. This one is both a joke and a real thing. Okay, so I love it that it all comes together and is for Python. So Patrick Mason, synonymous said the app PSF does on Twitter, the app PSF is searching for an executive director. So Eva, has been the Executive Director for 10 years. Thank you so much for that she's finally retiring, or moving on, I suppose. And so they're looking for a new person. But that's the real part. So if you want to apply for that, that'd be excellent. The joke is the Add PSF is actually the Pacific salmon foundation. So, so they they swim upstream. Exactly. But here's the thing. That's funny is the salmon foundation replied saying at the PSF is looking for an executive director at just PSF without the DE is not currently looking for one. Cheers on a successful search. So Patrick come back and says sorry for the confusion. The the sovereign Foundation says it happens. We're starting to feel like at the PSF family. It's not like at Java ever calls us broken heart.

0:00 Brian Okken  37:25

0:00 Fantastic. Yes. That's great. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Good. Sense of humor. No, no, I kind of want to give to the salmon foundation just for I know I do too. Yeah. All right.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  37:35

0:00 I got it. I had a quick pull up a little bit extra for this one. So I'm here in this hole. This will relate to you as well. So there's a this thing called the anime gan v2 face portrait thing that will take a picture that you put up here, and it will turn it into anime in like some really wild looking ways. Oh, wow. Isn't this

0:00 Brian Okken  37:55

0:00 crazy? Yeah, I want to animate me.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  37:58

0:00 So you can take a picture and throw it up here and get these. They're not very anime. Like, I don't think there's exaggerated as anime often is, but you put a picture up here doesn't work very well for me with classes. But I did put up here a picture of my dog. So there's a picture of my dog, which I'll try to link to this in the show notes or something. And that is a terrier mix of like 10 different things. It's very, very sweet, but I can't really give it a type. But if you turn it into anime, it looks like this. Which is pretty awesome.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  38:30

0:00 Well, I think it should have some kind of battle sword or helmet. I feel like yeah,

0:00 Michael Kennedy  38:35

0:00 it's just a way to chill this dog. It needs to be much more ready to go. Yeah. And battle. So this

0:00 Unknown Speaker  38:42

0:00 forming tear will go back

0:00 Brian Okken  38:45

0:00 to the other the enemy of the other humans. Yeah. So it looks like there's there's moving. Can you have

0:00 Michael Kennedy  38:53

0:00 Yeah, I don't know what this move. I couldn't make it move. Maybe if you drop a movie or something up there. There's like an Elon Musk and Bill Gates and MA.

0:00 Brian Okken  39:01

0:00 So I was hoping that you could do real time filters so we could possibly do our YouTube all anatomy sometime.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  39:08

0:00 My gosh, if we could do. We could do an episode like once a year where we're in anime. That would be fantastic. I would be all about it. Yeah, if first him Apple, they're just

0:00 Unknown Speaker  39:16

0:00 sure it's Snapchat filter. You know, I'm really on by on bytes. I'm not a cat.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  39:22

0:00 Exactly. Your honor. I'm not a cat. I'm ready to proceed.

0:00 Brian Okken  39:27

0:00 Maybe we could ask streamer to update that in their new update.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  39:30

0:00 Oh, yeah, that would be fantastic. All right. And then finally, a pie. A couple of versions of Python are out. The interesting one is 311 alpha two is now available for people to download. We've spoken about Mark Shannon's plan to make Python faster. Guido van Rossum has been helping over the last year. And they've done yeah, I answered them on. Go listen to it. Yeah, I recently had the at the moment the most recent episode on talk Python to me is uitto And Mark talking about the work they're doing to make Python five times faster. This is the first release that has some of those features in it. And you can test to see if this is any faster on your code. And they said they'd love people to try it out. So double shout out there to that. Alright, I think that's enough time for a joke. Although I feel like the salmon on surely kind of also a joke, but it was also really like, if you're looking for a job within the PSF, the PSF, not just PSF pick it up. Alright. But as somebody who does testing, Brian, I'm hoping this one touches heart here a little bit. You ready? Yeah. So here's a picture. It's a meme type of picture. And it has some text and it says hotfix. And production, could you describe that for our audience,

0:00 Brian Okken  40:41

0:00 this is an awesome picture. So you've got like a drainage pipe coming out in the water. And it's clearly not not attached to there's in and then it kind of is coming out in an angle, then going down, the pipe goes down, and straight down goes to be connected as one supposed to be connected, but it's not. But actually, there's a hole in the lower pipe. So the upper pipe actually just directly hit it all works.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  41:09

0:00 broken pipe on top, is being poured into a broken pipe, a hole in a broken pipe that is disconnected. It works. Yeah. So

0:00 Michael Kennedy  41:18

0:00 it's a hotfix in production, just make it work.

0:00 Brian Okken  41:21

0:00 I'm guessing somebody like just notice the break, and then just popped a hole in the pipe in the bottom to fix it. Something like that. Yeah, this is yeah,

0:00 Michael Kennedy  41:30

0:00 I feel like this is that rush to get that broken website, the website is down type of thing running as fast as possible. Well, you could be Facebook and the whole internal network could be broken. And you have to break out like a SATA soap in the data center door because the network is required to open the door, but the network is down and you got to get in the door to restore the network.

0:00 Brian Okken  41:51

0:00 Well, actually, you know, some stuff like this happens all the time, because you've got like a team that finds a problem. But the problem isn't in their code. It's in like some other component that happens to be written by the team in Germany that's on vacation because it's one of their million big holidays. And, and so you you just fix it in the other layer or something like that. So

0:00 Michael Kennedy  42:12

0:00 yeah, yeah, absolutely. It's awesome. All right. We got a little audience participation in this joke. Anthony Shaw says integration tests pass. Exactly. And well McKagan says leaky abstractions.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  42:24

0:00 Oh, nice. Well done. Yeah. Well

0:00 Michael Kennedy  42:26

0:00 done y'all out there. And well, then do Karen as well. Thanks for being here.

0:00 Unknown Speaker  42:30

0:00 I'm super excited, because I've been a longtime fan of both of your work. And thanks. I just thank you for letting me be here. And thank you for inviting me after I superfan girl do at pi Bay. It because I appreciate both of your work. Everybody should also help out these two wonderful podcast talk Python. Oh, and in the Python testing podcast in Python bytes on Patreon, as I have for a number of years, so thanks. Super excited to be here. Thank you so much for the invite.

0:00 Michael Kennedy  43:04

0:00 Yeah, it's great to have you here. Thanks again, Brian. Thanks as always, y'all later
